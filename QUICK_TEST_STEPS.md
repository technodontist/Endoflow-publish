- ✅ Frontend code updated with persistence
- ✅ Dev server running on port 3000

---

## 🎯 QUICK TEST (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Application
1. Open your browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
2. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/dentist**
3. Log in if needed

### Step 2: Open Developer Tools
1. Press **F12** (or right-click → Inspect)
2. Click on the **Console** tab
3. Clear any old logs (click trash icon)

### Step 3: Open Voice AI
1. Look for the **sparkle icon** (✨) - usually bottom-right corner
2. Click it to open the voice interface
3. **Watch the console** - you should see:
   ```
   🆕 [PERSISTENCE] No existing conversation ID found - will create new
   ```

### Step 4: First Query
**Type or speak**: *"Show me appointments for October"*

**Watch the console for**:
```
📤 [ENDOFLOW] Sending query: Show me appointments for October
💾 [PERSISTENCE] Saving conversation ID to localStorage: [some-uuid-here]
```

**Wait for AI response** (should list October appointments)

### Step 5: Follow-Up Query (THE KEY TEST!)
**Type or speak**: *"How many patients were there?"*

**Watch the console for**:
```
📤 [ENDOFLOW] Sending query: How many patients were there? conversationId: [uuid]
✅ [ENDOFLOW ACTION] Loaded conversation history: 2 messages
```

**AI Response Should**:
- Count the patients from October (without you saying "October" again!)
- Show it understands context ✅

---

## ✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS

### In Console:
- ✅ `💾 [PERSISTENCE] Saving conversation ID to localStorage`
- ✅ `conversationId: [uuid]` on second query
- ✅ `Loaded conversation history: 2 messages`

### In AI Response:
- ✅ References October without being told again
- ✅ Uses "there were X patients" (past tense, implying October)
- ✅ Doesn't ask "October of which year?" or "Which appointments?"

### In Browser Console (optional check):
```javascript
// Run this in browser console:
localStorage.getItem('endoflow_current_conversation_id')

// Should return a UUID like:
// "abc123-def456-ghi789-..."
```

## 🧪 BONUS TEST: Page Refresh

After completing Step 5:

1. **Press F5** to refresh the page
2. **Check console** - should see:
   ```
   💾 [PERSISTENCE] Loaded conversation ID from localStorage: [same-uuid]
   ```
3. **Ask another question**: *"What treatment did they need?"*
4. **Check console**:
   ```
   ✅ [ENDOFLOW ACTION] Loaded conversation history: 4 messages
   ```
5. **AI should still have context** from before refresh!

---

## ❌ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If ConversationId is NOT saved:
1. Check if you're in **Incognito/Private mode** (won't work there)
2. Check browser console for errors (red text)
3. Verify localStorage is enabled in browser settings

### If AI doesn't understand context:
1. Look for this in console:
   ```
   ✅ [ENDOFLOW ACTION] Loaded conversation history: X messages
   ```
2. If you see "No history" instead → conversationId lookup failed
3. Check that conversationId is the same across queries

### If nothing works:
Run this in your terminal:
```bash
node test-conversation-context-e2e.js
```

If that passes, the issue is frontend-specific.

## 📸 What Good Logs Look Like

```
🆕 [PERSISTENCE] No existing conversation ID found - will create new
📤 [ENDOFLOW] Sending query: Show me appointments for October
📥 [ENDOFLOW] Received result: { success: true, conversationId: "abc-123" }
💾 [PERSISTENCE] Saving conversation ID to localStorage: abc-123

[User asks follow-up]

📤 [ENDOFLOW] Sending query: How many patients were there? conversationId: abc-123
✅ [ENDOFLOW ACTION] Loaded conversation history: 2 messages
📥 [ENDOFLOW] Received result: { success: true }
```

---

## 🎉 Test Complete!

If you see:
- ✅ ConversationId being saved
- ✅ ConversationId being passed on follow-up
- ✅ History being loaded (2, 4, 6... messages)
- ✅ AI using context without clarification

**Then the feature is working perfectly!** 🚀
