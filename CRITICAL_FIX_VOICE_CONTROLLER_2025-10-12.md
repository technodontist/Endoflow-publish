# Critical Fix: Voice Controller Wake Word & Auto-Send Issues
**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Commit**: f73e567  
**Priority**: CRITICAL

## Issue Summary

The voice controller had multiple critical issues after a previous fix attempt:
1. Wake word detection was continuously restarting
2. Speech recognition was not capturing transcript
3. Empty messages were being auto-sent
4. The app became unusable for voice input

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Overly Aggressive Timer Reset
The previous fix reset the silence timer on EVERY speech event without checking if the main recognition was actually active. This interfered with the wake word detection system.

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
if (interimTranscript && autoModeRef.current && !autoSubmitRef.current) {
  resetSilenceTimer() // This ran even during wake word phase!
}
```

### Problem 2: Wake Word Interference
The wake word detection and main speech recognition were fighting for control because:
- Both use the same Web Speech API
- Timer resets were happening during wake word listening
- State management wasn't properly isolated

### Problem 3: Duplicate Auto-Submit Check
The handleAutoSubmit function was checking autoSubmitRef twice, causing it to exit early:
```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
if (autoSubmitRef.current) {
  return // This prevented legitimate submissions!
}
```

## Solution Applied

### Fix 1: Conditional Timer Reset
Only reset the silence timer when the main recognition is active:
```typescript
// FIXED CODE
if ((finalTranscript || interimTranscript) && 
    autoModeRef.current && 
    !autoSubmitRef.current && 
    isListeningRef.current) { // ‚Üê Critical addition
  resetSilenceTimer()
}
```

### Fix 2: Track Speech Time for All Results
Update last speech time for both interim and final results:
```typescript
if (interimTranscript) {
  lastSpeechTimeRef.current = Date.now()
}
```

### Fix 3: Simplified Auto-Submit Logic
Removed duplicate check and properly reset flag:
```typescript
const handleAutoSubmit = async () => {
  const query = transcriptRef.current.trim()
  if (!query || isProcessing) {
    autoSubmitRef.current = false // Reset flag if cannot submit
    return
  }
  // ... rest of logic
}
```

## Technical Details

### State Management
The component uses multiple refs to track state across closures:
- `isListeningRef` - Tracks if main recognition is active
- `isWakeWordListeningRef` - Tracks if wake word detection is active
- `autoSubmitRef` - Prevents duplicate submissions
- `silenceTimerRef` - Manages the 2-second silence timer

### Execution Flow

#### Wake Word Phase
1. Wake word recognition starts (isWakeWordListeningRef = true)
2. Listens for "Hey EndoFlow"
3. Does NOT trigger silence timers
4. On detection ‚Üí Stops wake word ‚Üí Starts main recognition

#### Main Recognition Phase  
1. Main recognition starts (isListeningRef = true)
2. Captures transcript (interim and final)
3. Resets silence timer on speech
4. After 2s silence ‚Üí Auto-submits
5. Returns to wake word phase

## Testing Protocol

### Test 1: Wake Word
```
Action: Say "Hey EndoFlow"
Expected: Activates once, starts listening
Console: Should see "‚úÖ [WAKE WORD] Wake word detected!"
```

### Test 2: Speech Capture
```
Action: Click mic, say "Find patient John"
Expected: Text appears in input field
Console: Should see "üìù [TRANSCRIPT] Final: find patient john"
```

### Test 3: Auto-Send
```
Action: Speak, then stop for 2 seconds
Expected: Message auto-sends
Console: Should see "üîá [AUTO MODE] 2s silence detected"
```

### Test 4: Command Phrase
```
Action: Say "Show appointments, go ahead"
Expected: Sends immediately on "go ahead"
Console: Should see "‚úÖ [AUTO MODE] Found command phrase: go ahead"
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - No continuous wake word restarts
   - Proper transcript capture logs
   - Timer reset logs only during main recognition

2. **UI Behavior**
   - Mic button shows correct state
   - Input field shows transcript
   - Messages send appropriately

3. **State Consistency**
   - Wake word and main recognition don't overlap
   - Auto-submit flag resets properly
   - Silence timer only active during speech

## Lessons Learned

1. **Isolation is Key**: Wake word detection and main recognition must be strictly isolated
2. **Ref Checks Matter**: Always check the correct ref (isListeningRef vs isWakeWordListeningRef)
3. **Test Holistically**: Changes to one feature can break others - test all voice features together
4. **Console Logs Help**: Comprehensive logging made debugging possible

## Prevention Measures

1. **Add E2E Tests**: Create automated tests for voice features
2. **State Diagram**: Document the state machine for voice controller
3. **Code Review**: Changes to voice controller need thorough review
4. **Feature Flags**: Consider feature flags for experimental changes

## Recovery Plan

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for error patterns
2. Verify microphone permissions
3. Test in different browsers (Chrome recommended)
4. Use manual mode as fallback
5. Revert to commit cdfc00c if critical
