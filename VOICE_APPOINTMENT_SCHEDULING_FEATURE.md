# AI-Powered Voice Appointment Scheduling Feature

## Overview
This feature enables assistants to schedule appointments using natural voice commands, similar to the voice transcription feature in the consultation tab. The AI automatically extracts appointment details from speech and auto-fills the booking form.

## Components

### 1. **AppointmentVoiceRecorder Component**
Location: `components/appointment/AppointmentVoiceRecorder.tsx`

A voice recording component that:
- Captures audio using the browser's MediaRecorder API
- Provides real-time transcription using Web Speech Recognition API
- Shows live AI detection indicators for appointment details
- Processes recordings with Gemini AI for intelligent data extraction

### 2. **Appointment Conversation Parser Service**
Location: `lib/services/appointment-conversation-parser.ts`

An AI-powered service that:
- Analyzes voice transcripts using Gemini 1.5 Flash
- Extracts appointment scheduling information:
  - Patient name and ID
  - Appointment type (cleaning, root canal, emergency, etc.)
  - Preferred date (natural language parsing: "tomorrow", "next Monday", etc.)
  - Preferred time (morning, afternoon, specific times)
  - Dentist preference
  - Pain level and urgency
  - Reason for visit
  - Duration estimate
- Provides confidence scoring (0-100%)
- Falls back to keyword extraction if AI fails

### 3. **Backend API Route**
Location: `app/api/voice/process-appointment-transcript/route.ts`

Processes voice transcripts and returns structured appointment data.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/voice/process-appointment-transcript`

**Request:**
- Form data with `transcript` (string) and `audio` (File)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "appointmentData": {
    "patientName": "John Smith",
    "appointmentType": "Teeth Cleaning",
    "preferredDate": "2025-10-10",
    "preferredTime": "14:00",
    "urgencyLevel": "medium",
    "reasonForVisit": "Regular cleaning",
    "durationMinutes": 60,
    "confidence": 85
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **Assistant opens appointment booking page**
2. **Clicks "Start Voice Scheduling" button**
3. **Speaks naturally**, for example:
   - "Schedule teeth cleaning for tomorrow at 2 PM"
   - "Book urgent appointment for John Smith next Monday morning"
   - "Set up root canal consultation with Dr. Johnson on Friday afternoon"
4. **Real-time transcription** appears with AI detection badges
5. **Clicks "Stop" to end recording**
6. **AI processes the transcript** and extracts appointment details
7. **Form fields auto-fill** with extracted information
8. **Assistant reviews and confirms** the appointment

## Example Voice Commands

### Basic Scheduling:
- "Schedule teeth cleaning for tomorrow at 2 PM"
- "Book a checkup next Monday morning"
- "Set up an appointment for Wednesday afternoon"

### With Patient Name:
- "Schedule appointment for Sarah Johnson tomorrow at 3 PM for filling"
- "Book emergency visit for Michael Brown today at 5 PM"

### With Urgency:
- "Urgent appointment needed for severe tooth pain tomorrow morning"
- "Emergency root canal for patient with pain level 8 out of 10"

### With Dentist Preference:
- "Schedule with Dr. Smith next Friday at 10 AM for crown placement"
- "Book consultation with Dr. Johnson this week"

### Complex Scheduling:
- "Schedule 90-minute root canal treatment for patient John Doe next Tuesday at 2 PM with Dr. Smith. Patient has severe pain and needs urgent care."

## Real-Time AI Detection Indicators

While recording, the UI shows badges for:
- ‚úÖ **Appointment Type Detected** - AI found the type of appointment
- ‚úÖ **Date Found** - Date/day mentioned in transcript
- ‚úÖ **Time Found** - Time mentioned in transcript
- ‚ö° **Urgency Detected** - Emergency or high priority keywords found
- üìä **Confidence Score** - Real-time confidence estimate

## Auto-Fill Behavior

When AI processing completes:
1. **Date Field** - Auto-populates with the parsed date
2. **Time Field** - Auto-selects the preferred time
3. **Duration** - Sets appropriate duration based on appointment type
4. **Notes Field** - Fills with reason for visit and additional context
5. **Success Toast** - Shows confirmation with confidence score

Example:
```
‚úÖ AI extracted appointment details with 85% confidence!
Teeth Cleaning on October 10, 2025 at 2:00 PM
```

## Natural Language Date Parsing

The AI understands relative dates:
- **"today"** ‚Üí Current date
- **"tomorrow"** ‚Üí Next day
- **"next Monday"** ‚Üí Date of next Monday
- **"this Friday"** ‚Üí Date of upcoming Friday
- **"next week"** ‚Üí Dates within next 7 days

And absolute dates:
- **"October 15th"**
- **"15th of October"**
- **"10/15/2025"**

## Time Parsing

Understands various time formats:
- **"2 PM"**, **"14:00"** ‚Üí 14:00
- **"morning"** ‚Üí 09:00
- **"afternoon"** ‚Üí 14:00
- **"evening"** ‚Üí 17:00
- **"9:30 AM"** ‚Üí 09:30

## Urgency Level Detection

AI automatically assesses urgency:
- **Urgent** - Pain level ‚â• 8, keywords: "emergency", "urgent", "ASAP"
- **High** - Pain level 5-7, keywords: "soon", "quickly"
- **Medium** - Default for routine appointments
- **Low** - Routine checkups, follow-ups

## Confidence Scoring

The AI provides confidence scores based on:
- Clarity of speech
- Completeness of information
- Ambiguity in transcript
- Presence of key appointment details

**High confidence (80-100%):** All key details clearly mentioned
**Medium confidence (50-79%):** Most details present with some ambiguity
**Low confidence (0-49%):** Missing key details or unclear speech

## Integration Points

### In Appointment Booking Form:
```tsx
<AppointmentVoiceRecorder
  onAppointmentDataExtracted={handleVoiceDataExtracted}
  isEnabled={true}
/>
```

### Callback Handler:
```tsx
const handleVoiceDataExtracted = (data: AppointmentExtraction) => {
  // Auto-fill form fields
  setSelectedDate(new Date(data.preferredDate))
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    scheduledTime: data.preferredTime,
    durationMinutes: data.durationMinutes,
    notes: data.reasonForVisit
  }))
}
```

## Environment Requirements

- **GEMINI_API_KEY** - Required for AI processing
- **Browser with Web Speech Recognition** - Chrome, Edge, Safari
- **Microphone access** - User must grant permission

## Fallback Behavior

If Gemini AI fails:
1. Falls back to keyword-based extraction
2. Uses regex patterns to extract basic information
3. Lower confidence score (typically 25%)
4. Still provides functional auto-fill

- [ ] Voice confirmation reading back the appointment details

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Microphone not working
**Solution:** Check browser permissions, ensure HTTPS connection

### Issue: Poor transcription accuracy
**Solution:** Speak clearly, reduce background noise, check microphone quality

### Issue: AI extraction fails
**Solution:** System falls back to keyword extraction automatically

### Issue: Date parsing incorrect
**Solution:** Use specific dates ("October 15th") instead of ambiguous terms

## Testing

### Test Cases:
1. **Basic appointment:** "Schedule cleaning tomorrow at 2 PM"
2. **With patient:** "Book appointment for John Smith next Monday"
3. **Urgent case:** "Emergency appointment for severe pain today"
4. **Complex:** "Schedule 90-minute root canal with Dr. Brown on Friday afternoon"
5. **Ambiguous time:** "Schedule appointment sometime next week" (should default to morning)

## Conclusion

The AI-powered voice scheduling feature brings the convenience of voice assistants to dental appointment booking, making the process faster, more accurate, and more accessible for clinic staff.
