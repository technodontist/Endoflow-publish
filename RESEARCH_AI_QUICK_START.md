1. **Be Specific**: Better questions = better insights
   - ❌ "Tell me about patients"
   - ✅ "What is the success rate of RCT in patients over 50?"

2. **Use Filters**: Select research projects or filter criteria for focused analysis

3. **Save Insights**: All conversations are automatically saved and can be reviewed later

4. **Compare Over Time**: Ask the same question monthly to track trends
