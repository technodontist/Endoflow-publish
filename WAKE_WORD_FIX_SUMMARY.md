# Wake Word Auto-Restart Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed
The wake word microphone was not automatically restarting after stopping the global voice recorder because the main microphone (`endoflow-master-ai`) was not properly unregistering from the voice manager when its recognition ended.

## Root Cause
The main mic's `onend` handler would fire when recognition ended naturally, but it wasn't unregistering the mic from the voice manager. This left the mic marked as "active" even though it wasn't actually running, which blocked the wake word from restarting.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Main Mic Unregistration in `onend` Handler (Lines 250-287)
Added three unregistration points in the main mic's `onend` handler:

**Auto-submit path (Line 261-262)**:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Unregister from voice manager since we're done
console.log('üßπ [MAIN MIC] Unregistering from voice manager (auto-submit path)')
voiceManager.unregisterMicUsage('endoflow-master-ai')
```

**Error path (Line 278-280)**:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Unregister from voice manager on error
console.log('üßπ [MAIN MIC] Unregistering from voice manager (error path)')
voiceManager.unregisterMicUsage('endoflow-master-ai')
```

**Stopped path (Line 283-285)** - MOST IMPORTANT:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Unregister from voice manager when not continuing
console.log('üßπ [MAIN MIC] Unregistering from voice manager (stopped path)')
voiceManager.unregisterMicUsage('endoflow-master-ai')
```

### 2. Race Condition Prevention (Lines 323-363)
Added double-check for voice manager state before wake word starts:

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Check voice manager FIRST before any other checks
const anyOtherMicActive = voiceManager.isAnyMicActive()

// ... later ...

// CRITICAL: Double-check voice manager right before starting
const stillAnyOtherMicActive = voiceManager.isAnyMicActive()
if (stillAnyOtherMicActive) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è [WAKE WORD] Other mics became active, aborting start')
  return
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Correct Automatic Flow:
1. **Wake word is ON and listening** for "Hey EndoFlow"
2. **User starts global voice recorder**
   - Global recorder registers with voice manager
   - Wake word detects other mic active
   - Wake word automatically pauses (but stays enabled)
3. **User records voice input**
   - Global recorder is active
   - Wake word remains paused
4. **User stops global voice recorder**
   - Global recorder unregisters from voice manager
   - Main mic's `onend` fires ‚Üí unregisters (THE FIX!)
   - Voice manager shows no active mics
5. **Wake word automatically restarts**
   - Wake word effect detects no other mics
   - Wake word restarts listening
   - Ready for "Hey EndoFlow" again!

## Important: You DON'T Need to Manually Toggle Wake Word!

### ‚ùå **Incorrect Usage** (What you were doing):
1. Wake word is ON
2. **Manually toggle wake word OFF**
3. Start global recorder
4. Stop global recorder
5. **Manually toggle wake word ON**

###‚úÖ **Correct Usage** (After fix):
1. Wake word is ON
2. **Start global recorder directly** (wake word auto-pauses)
3. Stop global recorder (wake word auto-restarts)
4. Wake word is listening again!

## Key Logs to Look For

### Success Indicators:
```
üßπ [MAIN MIC] Unregistering from voice manager (stopped path)
üé§ [VOICE MANAGER] Active mics: Array(0)
‚ôªÔ∏è [WAKE WORD] Restarting wake word detection...
‚úÖ [WAKE WORD] Started listening for "Hey EndoFlow"...
```

### What You Should NOT See:
```
‚è∏Ô∏è [WAKE WORD] Skipping restart - OtherMics: true
```

## Testing Procedure

### Test 1: Global Recorder ‚Üí Auto Restart
1. Ensure wake word toggle is ON
2. Click "Start Recording" on global voice recorder
3. Speak: "The patient tells that there is pain in tooth number 12"
4. Click "Stop" button
5. **Wait 1-2 seconds**
6. **Verify**: Wake word should show as listening
7. **Test**: Say "Hey EndoFlow" - should activate chat

### Test 2: Multiple Recordings
1. Start global recorder
2. Record something
3. Stop recorder (wake word auto-restarts)
4. Start global recorder again (wake word auto-pauses)
5. Stop recorder (wake word auto-restarts)
6. Repeat - should work seamlessly!

## Understanding Wake Word States

### Wake Word Toggle (isWakeWordActive):
- **ON**: Wake word feature is enabled
- **OFF**: Wake word feature is disabled

### Wake Word Listening (isListeningForWakeWord):
- **True**: Actively listening for "Hey EndoFlow"
- **False**: Paused (other mic active) or stopped (toggled off)

### Valid Combinations:
- `Active: true, Listening: true` = ‚úÖ **Listening for wake word**
- `Active: true, Listening: false` = ‚è∏Ô∏è **Paused** (other mic active)
- `Active: false, Listening: false` = üõë **Disabled** (toggled off)

## What Fixed Your Issue

Before the fix:
- Main mic stopped but didn't unregister
- Voice manager still showed mic as active
- Wake word saw "OtherMics: true" and wouldn't restart
- **Required manual toggle to fix**

After the fix:
- Main mic stops AND unregisters properly
- Voice manager shows no active mics
- Wake word sees "OtherMics: false" and auto-restarts
- **No manual intervention needed!**

## Verification from Your Logs

Your logs show the fix is working:

```
üßπ [MAIN MIC] Unregistering from voice manager (stopped path)  ‚Üê THE FIX!
üé§ [VOICE MANAGER] Active mics: Array(0)                        ‚Üê Properly cleared
‚ôªÔ∏è [WAKE WORD] Restarting wake word detection...              ‚Üê Auto-restart
‚úÖ [WAKE WORD] Started listening for "Hey EndoFlow"...        ‚Üê Success!
```

## Summary

The wake word auto-restart feature is now working as designed. You should **NOT need to manually toggle the wake word OFF/ON** anymore. Simply:

1. Keep wake word ON
2. Use global recorder as needed
3. Wake word auto-pauses and auto-resumes

The coordination between components is now fully automatic!
