## üéØ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Infrastructure Analysis** ‚úÖ
- Analyzed existing AI infrastructure (Gemini 2.0 Flash API)
- Reviewed RAG implementation (`lib/services/rag-service.ts`)
- Examined medical knowledge database schema
- Understood vector embedding system (Gemini 768-dim embeddings)

### 2. **Action Functions Created** ‚úÖ
Created `lib/actions/self-learning.ts` with three core functions:

#### `searchTreatmentOptionsAction(diagnosis: string)`
- Uses RAG vector search to find relevant research papers
- Extracts 2-5 distinct treatment options using Gemini AI
- Returns structured data with difficulty levels, success rates, and source citations
- Filters by diagnosis keywords in the medical knowledge base

#### `getTreatmentStepsAction(treatmentName: string, diagnosis?: string)`
- Performs RAG search for detailed procedure protocols
- Uses Gemini to extract 5-10 sequential steps from literature
- Includes key points, warnings, tips, and source references
- Maintains clinical accuracy and proper terminology

#### `askTreatmentQuestionAction(question: string)`
- Processes natural language questions about treatments
- Searches knowledge base using semantic similarity
- Generates comprehensive answers with citations
- Provides evidence-based guidance or general clinical knowledge

### 3. **Component Integration** ‚úÖ
Updated `components/dentist/self-learning-assistant.tsx`:
- Replaced all mock data with real RAG-powered API calls
- Integrated with Gemini AI for treatment extraction and Q&A
- Added empty state handling for when no knowledge base exists
- Maintained all UI/UX features (step navigation, chat interface, etc.)

### 4. **Build & Testing** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Successful build with no compilation errors
- ‚úÖ TypeScript type safety maintained
- ‚úÖ Bundle size optimized (231 kB for dentist route)
- ‚úÖ All imports and dependencies resolved

## üéì How It Works

### Example 1: Searching for Treatments

```typescript
// User searches for "Pulpitis"
searchTreatmentOptionsAction("Pulpitis")

// RAG Process:
1. Generate embedding for query: "Treatment options for Pulpitis..."
2. Vector search in medical_knowledge table
3. Find top 10 relevant research papers (similarity > 0.5)
4. Extract treatments using Gemini AI:
   - Root Canal Treatment (RCT)
   - Vital Pulp Therapy (VPT)
   - Pulpotomy
5. Return structured data with sources

// User sees:
- 3 treatment options with difficulty, duration, success rates
- Citations to research papers used
```

### Example 2: Learning Procedure Steps

```typescript
// User selects "Root Canal Treatment"
getTreatmentStepsAction("Root Canal Treatment", "Pulpitis")

// RAG Process:
1. Generate embedding for: "Step-by-step protocol for RCT..."
2. Vector search for procedural details
3. Find 8 relevant clinical protocols
4. Gemini extracts 7 sequential steps:
   Step 1: Patient Assessment
   Step 2: Anesthesia
   Step 3: Access Preparation
   ... etc
5. Each step includes keyPoints, warnings, tips

// User sees:
- Side-by-side navigation of steps
- Detailed guidance for each phase
- Warnings in red boxes
- Tips in blue boxes
```

### Example 3: Asking Questions

```typescript
// User asks: "How to perform RCT?"
askTreatmentQuestionAction("How to perform RCT?")

// RAG Process:
1. Generate embedding for question
2. Search for relevant RCT literature
3. Format context from top 5 papers
4. Gemini generates comprehensive answer:
   - Direct protocol steps
   - Success factors
   - Evidence citations [Source 1], [Source 2]
   - Clinical considerations
5. Return answer with citation details

// User sees:
- Formatted answer with markdown
- Inline citations [Source X]
- Citation list with journal details
```
