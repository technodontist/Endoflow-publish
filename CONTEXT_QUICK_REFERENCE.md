# Conversation Context - Quick Reference

## What Changed? ✨

Your EndoFlow AI now **remembers** what you're talking about! No more repeating patient names, tooth numbers, or treatment details in every question.

---

## How It Works 🧠

### The AI Now Tracks:
1. **Patient Names** - "Deepti Tomar", "John Doe"
2. **Tooth Numbers** - "tooth 23", "46"
3. **Treatments** - "root canal", "extraction", "pulpotomy"
4. **Diagnoses** - "pulpitis", "periodontitis"
5. **Time References** - "tomorrow", "today", "next week"

---

## Real Examples 💬

### ✅ WORKS NOW (Context Maintained):
```
You: "tell me about my upcoming appointment"
AI: "You have 1 appointment: Deepti Tomar - tomorrow at 10:00 AM for RCT on tooth 23"

You: "what treatment are we doing?"
AI: "You're performing root canal treatment on tooth 23 for Deepti Tomar"
     👆 Remembers the patient and tooth from previous message!

You: "which tooth?"
AI: "Tooth 23"
     👆 Still remembers!
```

### ✅ SHORT FOLLOW-UPS:
```
You: "tell me about patient Deepti Tomar"
AI: [Shows patient details]

You: "23"
AI: "For tooth 23 on patient Deepti Tomar..."
     👆 Understands short references
```

### ✅ TOPIC CONTINUATION:
```
You: "how many appointments tomorrow?"
AI: [Shows appointment list]

You: "what about next week?"
AI: [Shows next week's appointments]
     👆 "what about" signals continuation
```

## Starting a New Topic 🆕

Want to change subjects? Use these phrases:

- "let's start a new chat"
- "new question"
- "different topic"
- "start over"
- "forget that"
- "new conversation"

**Example**:
```
You: "tell me about patient John Doe"
AI: [Shows John's info]

You: "let's start a new chat - tell me about partial pulpotomy"
AI: [Provides general info about pulpotomy]
     👆 Context reset! No longer talking about John Doe
```

---

## What You'll See in Logs 📊

### ✅ Good Signs (Context Working):
```
➡️ [TOPIC CHANGE] Continuation indicator found: "what treatment"
🔗 [TOPIC CHANGE] Query references recent entity
📏 [TOPIC CHANGE] Short query (3 words) - likely follow-up
📝 [CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT] Enhanced: "what treatment for patient Deepti Tomar"
KEY ENTITIES: Deepti Tomar, tooth 23, root canal
```

### ⚠️ If You See This (Context Reset):
```
🔄 [TOPIC CHANGE] Explicit phrase detected: "let's start a new chat"
🆕 [TOPIC CHANGE] No history - new conversation
```

---

## Tips for Best Results 💡

### ✅ DO:
- Ask follow-up questions naturally
- Use short queries like "what about..." or "and...?"
- Reference "the patient", "that tooth", "it"
- Let the conversation flow naturally

### ❌ DON'T:
- Repeat information unnecessarily
- Use "new" or "different" unless you want to change topics
- Worry about being too brief - short questions work!

## Common Patterns 🎯

### Pattern 1: Appointment → Treatment Discussion
```
1. "tell me about my appointments tomorrow"
2. "what treatment for the first one?"
3. "which tooth?"
4. "show me the treatment plan"
```
All maintain context! ✅

### Pattern 2: Patient → Details
```
1. "tell me about patient Deepti Tomar"
2. "what treatments have they had?"
3. "schedule a follow-up"
```
Patient name carried through! ✅

### Pattern 3: Clinical Question Chain
```
1. "what's the protocol for tooth 23?"
2. "it's chronic pulpitis"
3. "what are the contraindications?"
4. "show me similar cases"
```
Tooth number + diagnosis maintained! ✅

## Testing Checklist ✔️

Try these to verify it's working:

- [ ] Ask about an appointment, then ask "what treatment?"
- [ ] Mention a patient, then ask "what about them?"
- [ ] Say a tooth number, then ask "treatment plan?"
- [ ] Use "23" (just the number) as a follow-up
- [ ] Try "let's start a new chat" to reset

## Need Help? 🆘

**Problem**: Context not working
**Solution**: Check browser console for logs, look for "TOPIC CHANGE" messages

**Problem**: Too much context retention
**Solution**: Use "let's start a new chat" to reset

**Problem**: AI doesn't understand short queries
**Solution**: Add a bit more context: "what about the treatment?" instead of just "treatment?"
