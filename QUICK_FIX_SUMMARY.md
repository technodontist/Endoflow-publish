# Quick Fix Summary - Appointment Inquiry

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### Problem
- Appointment viewing queries misclassified as booking
- System tried to **schedule** appointments when user wanted to **view** them
- Network timeouts crashed the system

### Solution
- ✅ Split `appointment_scheduling` into 2 distinct intents
- ✅ Created dedicated `delegateToAppointmentInquiry()` agent
- ✅ Added retry logic with 25s timeout
- ✅ Better error handling

---

## 📊 **Before vs After**

### BEFORE ❌
```
Query: "What's my schedule today?"
→ Intent: appointment_scheduling
→ Agent: Scheduler (tries to BOOK)
→ Result: "Missing patient name..."
```

### AFTER ✅
```
Query: "What's my schedule today?"
→ Intent: appointment_inquiry
→ Agent: Appointment Inquiry
→ Result: "You have 3 appointments:
           1. John Doe - 09:00
           2. Maria Garcia - 11:00
           3. Sarah Johnson - 14:00"
```

## 🎯 **New Intent Types**

| Intent | Purpose | Examples |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `appointment_inquiry` | **View** appointments | "What's my schedule?", "How many patients today?" |
| `appointment_booking` | **Create** appointments | "Schedule John for 2 PM", "Book RCT tomorrow" |

## 🧪 **Quick Test**

```bash
# 1. Start server
npm run dev

# 2. Navigate to http://localhost:3002/dentist

# 3. Say: "What's my schedule today?"
# Expected: List of appointments (not error)

# 4. Say: "Tell me more about them"
# Expected: Detailed appointment info (context maintained)

# 5. Say: "By the way, find patients with RCT"
# Expected: Patient list (topic changed, context cleared)
```
