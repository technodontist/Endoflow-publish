## 🎯 Quick Examples

### Example 1: Check Schedule
```
You: "Hey EndoFlow"
You: "Show me today's appointments"
[2s pause]
AI: "You have 5 appointments today..."
You: "What's the first one"
[2s pause]
AI: "Your first appointment is John Doe at 9am..."
```

### Example 2: Use Command Phrases
```
You: "Hey EndoFlow"
You: "Find patients with RCT, search it"
[Instantly submits on "search it"]
AI: "I found 3 patients..."
```

### Example 3: Quick Actions
```
You: "Hey EndoFlow, book appointment for Sarah tomorrow at 3pm, do it"
[Activates, listens, submits immediately]
AI: "I've scheduled the appointment..."
```

## 🎨 Command Phrases (Instant Submit)

Say any of these at the end of your query:
- **"do it"** - Most common
- **"search it"** - For searches
- **"send it"** - For sending/creating
- **"go ahead"** - Natural trigger
- **"show me"** - At start of query

**Full list**: do it, search it, send it, go ahead, execute, submit, find it, show me, that's it, done, okay go, ok go

---

## 🎛️ Controls

### Purple "Auto" Button
- **Purple = ON** - Hands-free mode (default)
- **Gray = OFF** - Manual mode (click to submit)

### Green "Wake" Button
- **Green = ON** - "Hey EndoFlow" wake word active
- **Gray = OFF** - Click to open chat

### Speaker Icon
- **Visible = ON** - AI speaks responses
- **Muted = OFF** - Text only

---

## ⏱️ How Timing Works

### 2-Second Rule
- Speak your query
- **Natural pause** (2 seconds)
- Auto-submits

### Why 2 Seconds?
- Long enough for natural speech pauses
- Short enough to feel responsive
- Prevents premature submission

### Override with Commands
Don't want to wait 2 seconds? Just say "do it" or "search it" at the end!
