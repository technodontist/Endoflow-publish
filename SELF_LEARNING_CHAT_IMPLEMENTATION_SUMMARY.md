# Self-Learning Chat Session Persistence Implementation

## 🎉 Overview

Successfully implemented persistent chat session storage for the **Self-Learning AI Assistant** feature, replicating the chat experience from the Clinic Analysis AI but tailored for treatment learning with diagnosis and patient context support.

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Database Schema (Migration File)
**File**: `lib/db/migrations/add_self_learning_chat_sessions.sql`

Created two new database tables:

#### Table: `api.self_learning_chat_sessions`
- Stores chat session/thread information
- Tracks session metadata (title, message count, last activity)
- Links to patient context (optional)
- Stores diagnosis and treatment context
- Auto-updates via database triggers

#### Table: `api.self_learning_messages`
- Stores individual messages within sessions
- Supports user and assistant roles
- Maintains message sequence/order
- Stores metadata (evidence info, source counts, etc.)
- Cascade deletes when session is removed

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ✅ Dentists can only access their own sessions
- ✅ Requires active dentist role
- ✅ Proper foreign key constraints

**Performance Features:**
- ✅ Indexes on all critical columns
- ✅ Efficient query patterns
- ✅ Database triggers for auto-updates

---

### 2. Server Actions (API Layer)
**File**: `lib/actions/self-learning-chat.ts`

Implemented 7 server actions for session management:

#### `createLearningSessionAction(params?)`
- Creates new chat session
- Accepts optional title, diagnosis, treatment, and patient context
- Auto-generates title if not provided
- Returns newly created session object

#### `getLearningSessionsAction()`
- Fetches all sessions for current authenticated dentist
- Orders by last activity (most recent first)
- Returns array of session objects

#### `getLearningMessagesAction(sessionId)`
- Loads all messages for a specific session
- Orders by sequence number (chronological)
- Verifies session ownership
- Returns array of message objects

#### `saveLearningMessageAction(params)`
- Saves user or assistant message to database
- Auto-increments sequence number
- Stores optional metadata
- Updates session metadata via trigger

#### `deleteLearningSessionAction(sessionId)`
- Deletes session and all its messages (cascade)
- Verifies ownership before deletion
- Returns success status

#### `renameLearningSessionAction(sessionId, newTitle)`
- Updates session title
- Validates title length (max 100 chars)
- Verifies ownership

#### `autoTitleLearningSessionAction(sessionId, firstMessage)`
- Auto-generates title from first user message
- Only applies to default-titled sessions
- Truncates to 50 characters with ellipsis
- Non-blocking (won't fail message save if title update fails)

---

### 3. UI Integration (Frontend)
**File**: `components/dentist/self-learning-assistant.tsx`

#### New State Variables Added:
```typescript
const [chatSessions, setChatSessions] = useState<LearningSessions[]>([])
const [currentSessionId, setCurrentSessionId] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [isLoadingSessions, setIsLoadingSessions] = useState(true)
const [isCreatingSession, setIsCreatingSession] = useState(false)
const [showSessionSidebar, setShowSessionSidebar] = useState(true)
```

#### New Session Management Functions:
- `loadSessions()` - Loads all sessions from database on mount
- `loadSessionMessages(sessionId)` - Loads messages for specific session
- `createNewSession()` - Creates new session with patient context
- `switchSession(sessionId)` - Switches to different session
- `deleteSession(sessionId)` - Deletes session with confirmation

#### Updated Chat Submit Handler:
The `handleChatSubmit()` function now:
1. Ensures a session exists (creates if needed)
2. Saves user message to database
3. Auto-titles session from first message
4. Calls AI to generate response
5. Saves assistant response to database
6. All messages persist across page refreshes

#### New Session Sidebar UI:
- **Location**: Left side of chat interface (300px width)
- **Features**:
  - "New Chat" button at top
  - List of all previous sessions
  - Shows session title, message count, last message preview
  - Patient name badge (if linked)
  - Delete button (hover to reveal)
  - Active session highlighted in teal
  - Loading states and empty states
  - Scrollable list with proper styling

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### Starting a New Learning Session
1. User navigates to **Self Learning Assistant** page
2. Clicks on **AI Chat Assistant** tab
3. Sees session sidebar with "New Chat" button
4. Clicks "New Chat" to start fresh session
5. Types first question
6. Session is auto-titled based on question
7. All subsequent messages auto-save

### Continuing Previous Session
1. User returns to Self Learning Assistant
2. Most recent session auto-loads
3. All previous messages are displayed
4. User can click any session in sidebar to switch
5. Session context (patient, diagnosis, treatment) preserved

### Patient-Specific Learning
1. User links patient in "Patient Context" section
2. Creates new chat session
3. Patient info automatically attached to session
4. Patient name badge shows in session list
5. AI responses personalized for that patient
6. Patient's medical history considered in answers

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- All actions verify user is authenticated
- Only active dentists can create/access sessions
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforces data isolation
- Service role bypasses RLS for admin operations

### Data Protection
- Dentists only see their own sessions
- Patient data access follows existing RLS policies
- No cross-dentist data leakage possible
- Cascade deletion prevents orphaned messages

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Database Level
- Indexed columns: `dentist_id`, `patient_id`, `session_id`, `timestamp`
- Efficient ORDER BY queries using indexed columns
- Database triggers reduce round-trips
- Cascade delete improves cleanup performance

### Application Level
- Sessions loaded once on mount, cached in state
- Messages loaded only when switching sessions
- Optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
- Lazy loading with scroll areas for large lists
