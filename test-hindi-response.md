### ‚úÖ Test 5: Different Query Types

Try these in Hindi:

## Debugging Tips

### If Hindi response is not working:

**Check Console Logs:**
```javascript
// Look for these in browser console:
üåê [MAIN MIC] Language set to: hi-IN
üì§ [ENDOFLOW] Sending query: [your query]
üîä [TTS] Using Hindi voice for speech
‚úÖ [TTS] Found Hindi voice: [voice name]
```

**Verify Language Parameter:**
```javascript
// In Network tab, check the request payload:
{
  query: "your query",
  conversationId: "...",
  language: "hi-IN"  // ‚Üê Should be present
}
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Response still in English
**Cause:** Language parameter not being passed  
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors, verify language dropdown selection

### Issue 2: No Hindi voice for TTS
**Cause:** System doesn't have Hindi TTS voice installed  
**Solution:** 
- Windows: Settings ‚Üí Time & Language ‚Üí Speech ‚Üí Add Hindi voice
- Mac: System Preferences ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Speech ‚Üí Add Hindi voice
- **Fallback:** System will use default voice (still works, just not in Hindi)

### Issue 3: Translation takes too long
**Cause:** First translation might be slower  
**Solution:** Subsequent translations should be faster; this is normal

### Issue 4: Translation quality issues
**Cause:** Gemini AI translation might not be perfect for specific medical terms  
**Solution:** Can adjust the `translateToHindi` function prompt in:  
`lib/services/endoflow-master-ai.ts` (Line 1900-1955)

**Monitor in DevTools:**
```javascript
// Check Network tab for timing:
/api/endoflow/process-query
  - Initial processing: ~500ms
  - Translation (if Hindi): ~500ms
  - Total: ~1-2s
```

4. ‚úÖ **Get user feedback** on translation quality
5. ‚úÖ **Monitor performance** in production

**Optional Enhancements:**
