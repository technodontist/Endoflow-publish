4. Value: `2`
5. Click "Refresh" → Should show 4 matching patients

---

### ⚡ **Filter Option 3: Emergency Cases**

**Goal**: Patients with severe pain (pain > 7)

**Filters**:
1. **Pain Intensity (1-10)** `greater than` `7`

**Expected Result**: **1 patient** (Patient with pain intensity = 8)

**How to set up**:
1. Create New Project
2. Add filter: **Pain Intensity (1-10)**
3. Operator: `Greater Than`
4. Value: `7`
5. Click "Refresh" → Should show 1 matching patient

---

### 🦷 **Filter Option 4: Caries Patients (Moderate Pain)**

**Goal**: Find patients with moderate caries who have some level of pain

**Filters**:
1. **Provisional Diagnosis (JSONB)** `contains` `"caries"`
2. **AND** **Pain Intensity (1-10)** `greater than` `0`

**Expected Result**: **1-2 patients**

**How to set up**:
1. Create New Project
2. Add filter 1: **Provisional Diagnosis (JSONB)** → Contains → `caries`
3. Click "+ Add Filter Rule"
4. Select `AND` (logical operator)
5. Add filter 2: **Pain Intensity (1-10)** → Greater Than → `0`
6. Click "Refresh"

## 🔧 Complete Filter Reference

### Available JSONB Filters (Your Data):

| Filter Field | Example Values in Your DB | Recommended Operator |
|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Pain Intensity (1-10)** | 0, 1, 3, 4, 8 | `>`, `<`, `=`, `between` |
| **Final Diagnosis (JSONB)** | "Tooth missing", "Restored with filling", "Dental caries detected" | `contains` |
| **Provisional Diagnosis (JSONB)** | "Moderate Caries", "Dental caries detected", "Restored with filling" | `contains` |
| **Pain Location** | (mostly empty in your data) | - |
| **Pain Duration** | "2" | `equals`, `contains` |

## 📝 Step-by-Step: Create Your First Research Project

### **Example: "Moderate Pain Caries Study"**

1. **Login as Dentist**
   - Email: `dr.nisarg@endoflow.com`
   - Password: `endoflow123`

2. **Navigate to Research**
   - Go to Dentist Dashboard
   - Click **"Research V2 (Advanced)"** tab

3. **Create Project**
   - Click **"Create New Project"** button
   - Fill in:
     - **Project Name**: "Moderate Pain Caries Study"
     - **Description**: "Patients with moderate caries experiencing pain"

4. **Add Filter Criteria**
   - Click **"Define Patient Cohort"** section
   - **Filter 1**:
     - Field: `Provisional Diagnosis (JSONB)` (blue section)
     - Operator: `Contains`
     - Value: `moderate`
   - Click **"+ Add Filter Rule"**
   - **Filter 2**:
     - Logical: `AND`
     - Field: `Pain Intensity (1-10)` (teal section)
     - Operator: `Greater Than`
     - Value: `0`

5. **View Results**
   - Look at **"Live Patient Matching"** panel on the right
   - Should show: "Total matching patients: 1-2"
   - Patient list appears with match percentages

6. **Save Project**
   - Click **"Save Project"** button (top right)
   - Project appears in "Your Research Projects" list

## 🚀 Quick Wins - Filters That Will Work

✅ **Confirmed Working Filters**:
- ✓ Pain Intensity > 2 → 4 patients
- ✓ Pain Intensity > 7 → 1 patient
- ✓ Provisional Diagnosis contains "moderate" → 2 patients
- ✓ Provisional Diagnosis contains "caries" → varies
- ✓ Final Diagnosis contains "filling" → varies

❌ **Won't Work (No Data)**:
- ✗ Final Diagnosis contains "caries" → 0 patients (data uses provisional instead)
- ✗ Pain Location (empty in most consultations)
- ✗ Primary Diagnosis (using different structure)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use "Contains" for Text Fields
When filtering diagnosis fields, use `Contains` instead of `Equals` because:
- Data is stored in arrays: `["Moderate Caries", "Tooth decay"]`
- Contains searches within the joined text
- More flexible matching

### Tip 2: Start Broad, Then Narrow
1. First filter: Find all patients with any diagnosis (`Provisional Diagnosis contains ""`)
2. Add second filter: Narrow by pain level (`Pain > 2`)
3. Add third filter: Refine further

### Tip 3: Check "Filter Summary"
The Filter Summary section shows exactly what's being searched:
- `Provisional Diagnosis (JSONB) contains "moderate"`
- `AND Pain Intensity (1-10) is greater than 2`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "0 matching patients"

**Check**:
1. ✓ Are you using the right filter fields?
   - Use `Provisional Diagnosis (JSONB)` not `Primary Diagnosis`
   - Use `Final Diagnosis (JSONB)` for completed diagnoses

2. ✓ Is your search term too specific?
   - Try `contains "caries"` instead of `equals "moderate caries"`
   - Use partial matches

3. ✓ Run the test script:
   ```bash
   node test-existing-data-filters.js
   ```
   This shows exactly what data exists in your database

### Problem: Filter shows different count than expected

**Solution**: Click the **"Refresh"** button in the Live Patient Matching panel to reload results.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option A: Use Existing Data (Immediate)
- Follow the filter examples above
- Create research projects with working combinations
- Export patient lists for analysis

### Option B: Create Better Data (Recommended)
1. Go to Enhanced Consultation
2. Create new consultations with:
   - Clear Primary Diagnosis in the diagnosis field
   - Specific pain locations
   - Complete clinical examination data
3. Future consultations will have richer data for filtering

## 📊 Filter Cheat Sheet

Copy-paste these into your research project:

**Moderate Cases**:
```
Provisional Diagnosis (JSONB) contains "moderate"
```

**Pain Patients**:
```
Pain Intensity (1-10) > 2
```

**Emergency Cases**:
```
Pain Intensity (1-10) > 7
```

**Caries with Pain**:
```
Provisional Diagnosis (JSONB) contains "caries"
AND Pain Intensity (1-10) > 0
```

**Restored Patients**:
```
Final Diagnosis (JSONB) contains "restored"
```
