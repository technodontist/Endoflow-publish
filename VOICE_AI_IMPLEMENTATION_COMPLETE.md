  - HOPI (pain characteristics, aggravating/relieving factors, onset details)
- Confidence scoring (0-100%)
- Automatic fallback handling
- Real-time keyword detection helpers

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
analyzeMedicalConversation(transcript: string): Promise<VoiceTranscriptAnalysis>
detectKeywords(transcript: string, keywords: string[]): string[]
analyzeConversationCompleteness(transcript: string): { hasChiefComplaint, hasHOPI, confidence }
```

    "pain_scale": 8,
    "location_detail": "upper right side",
    "onset_duration": "3 days ago"
  },
  "confidence": 85
}
```

### **Test Scenario 2: HOPI Details**

**Input Transcript:**
```
"The pain is sharp and throbbing, worse with cold drinks and when chewing.
Painkillers provide temporary relief. It started suddenly last week."
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "hopi": {
    "pain_characteristics": {
      "quality": "sharp, throbbing",
      "intensity": 8
    },
    "aggravating_factors": ["cold drinks", "chewing"],
    "relieving_factors": ["painkillers"],

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: AI Analysis Not Working**

**Symptoms:** Voice recording works but tabs don't auto-fill

**Solutions:**
1. Check Gemini API key is configured:
   ```bash
   echo $GEMINI_API_KEY
   ```
2. Check browser console for API errors
3. Verify fallback keyword extraction works (low confidence)
4. Check network tab for `/api/voice/process-global-transcript` response

### **Issue: Low Confidence Scores**

**Symptoms:** Confidence <50%, poor extraction

**Solutions:**
1. **Speak more clearly** - Enunciate medical terms
2. **Use keywords** - Mention "chief complaint", "pain scale", etc.
3. **Provide details** - Include location, duration, quality
4. **Check transcript accuracy** - Web Speech API may mishear words

### **Issue: Badges Not Showing**

**Symptoms:** No real-time detection badges appear

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure transcript contains medical keywords:
   - Chief Complaint: "pain", "complaint", "problem"
   - HOPI: "started", "sharp", "dull", "throbbing"
2. Check `analyzeConversationCompleteness()` function import
3. Verify transcript is being captured (check state in dev tools)
