# Conversation Context Retention - Testing Guide

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to conversation context retention and provides test cases to verify the functionality.

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Entity Extraction System**
- Added `extractConversationContext()` function that analyzes the last 5 messages
- Extracts and tracks:
  - Patient names (e.g., "Deepti Tomar", "John Doe")
  - Tooth numbers in FDI notation (e.g., "23", "46")
  - Diagnoses (pulpitis, periodontitis, etc.)
  - Treatment types (RCT, extraction, pulpotomy, etc.)
  - Appointment timeframes (today, tomorrow, scheduled)

### 2. **Enhanced Query Context**
- Modified `enhanceQueryWithContext()` to:
  - Accept extracted context as a parameter
  - Include key entities in the enhancement prompt
  - Better resolve pronouns and implicit references

### 3. **Improved Topic Change Detection**
- Added continuation indicators that prevent false topic changes:
  - "what about", "how about", "also", "and"
  - "tell me about", "show me", "can you find"
  - "tooth number", "patient", "treatment"
- Entity-aware detection: If query mentions recent entities, it's a follow-up
- Short query detection: Queries with ‚â§10 words are likely follow-ups
- Explicit topic change phrases for deliberate context resets

### 4. **Context Propagation**
- All agent delegates now receive and use extracted context
- Patient inquiry agent automatically uses last mentioned patient name if not specified
- Treatment planning agent can reference context for missing entities

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Appointment Follow-up Questions
**Expected**: Context should be maintained across multiple questions about the same appointment.

```
Query 1: "tell me about my upcoming appointment"
Expected: System fetches appointments and shows patient details (e.g., Deepti Tomar)

Query 2: "what treatment are we going to do"
Expected: Recognizes "Deepti Tomar" from context, mentions root canal treatment

Query 3: "which tooth number?"
Expected: References patient from Query 1, provides tooth number (e.g., 23)

Query 4: "show me the treatment plan for that tooth"
Expected: Uses patient + tooth number from previous queries
```

**Key Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Logs show: "‚Üí [TOPIC CHANGE] Continuation indicator found"
- ‚úÖ Logs show: "üîó [TOPIC CHANGE] Query references recent entity"
- ‚úÖ Logs show: "üìù [CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT] Enhanced: ..."
- ‚ùå Logs should NOT show: "üÜï [TOPIC CHANGE] New topic detected"

### Scenario 2: Patient Context Continuation
**Expected**: After discussing a patient, follow-up questions should automatically reference them.

```
Query 1: "tell me about patient Deepti Tomar"
Expected: Fetches Deepti Tomar's details

Query 2: "what treatments have they received?"
Expected: "They" resolves to Deepti Tomar automatically

Query 3: "schedule a follow-up for next week"
Expected: Uses Deepti Tomar from context, no need to re-specify
```

**Key Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Logs show: "Last mentioned patient: Deepti Tomar"
- ‚úÖ Entity extraction includes patient name in recentEntities
- ‚úÖ Patient name auto-filled from context

### Scenario 3: Treatment Planning with Context
**Expected**: Treatment discussions should maintain tooth number and diagnosis context.

```
Query 1: "what's the treatment plan for tooth 23"
Expected: Asks for diagnosis or treatment details

Query 2: "it's a root canal for chronic pulpitis"
Expected: References tooth 23 from Query 1

Query 3: "what are the contraindications?"
Expected: References both tooth 23 and RCT from previous context
```

**Key Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Entity extraction includes "tooth 23"
- ‚úÖ Entity extraction includes "root canal", "pulpitis"
- ‚úÖ Context enhancement resolves "it" and "the" references

### Scenario 4: Explicit Topic Change
**Expected**: When user explicitly starts a new topic, context should reset.

```
Query 1: "tell me about patient John Doe"
Expected: Fetches John Doe's information

Query 2: "let's start a new chat - tell me about partial pulpotomy"
Expected: Context resets, treats as new conversation, provides general info
```

**Key Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Logs show: "üîÑ [TOPIC CHANGE] Explicit phrase detected: 'let's start a new chat'"
- ‚úÖ New conversationId generated
- ‚úÖ Previous patient context NOT applied

### Scenario 5: Short Follow-up Queries
**Expected**: Very short queries should be treated as follow-ups.

```
Query 1: "how many appointments do I have tomorrow?"
Expected: Shows appointment list

Query 2: "23"
Expected: Recognizes as follow-up (likely answering previous question about tooth number)

Query 3: "and what treatment?"
Expected: Continues conversation context
```

**Key Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Logs show: "üìè [TOPIC CHANGE] Short query (1 words) - likely follow-up"
- ‚úÖ Context maintained

---

## How to Test

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser Console
- Navigate to http://localhost:3002/dentist
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Check Console tab for detailed logs

### 3. Use Voice or Text Input
- Say "Hey EndoFlow" to activate voice mode
- Or manually type queries

### 4. Monitor Logs
Look for these key log entries:

**Context Extraction:**
```
üìù [CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT] Original: what treatment
üìù [CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT] Enhanced: what treatment for patient Deepti Tomar on tooth 23
```

**Topic Change Detection:**
```
‚û°Ô∏è [TOPIC CHANGE] Continuation indicator found: "what treatment"
üîó [TOPIC CHANGE] Query references recent entity - treating as follow-up
üìè [TOPIC CHANGE] Short query (3 words) - likely follow-up
```

**Entity Usage:**
```
üìù [PATIENT INQUIRY] Using patient name from context: Deepti Tomar
KEY ENTITIES FROM CONVERSATION: Deepti Tomar, tooth 23, root canal
```

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Context Maintained**: Follow-up questions automatically reference previous entities
‚úÖ **No False Topic Changes**: Related queries don't trigger context resets
‚úÖ **Entity Resolution**: Pronouns and implicit references are resolved correctly
‚úÖ **Natural Flow**: Conversation feels natural, like talking to a human assistant
‚úÖ **Explicit Resets Work**: User can deliberately start a new conversation

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Context Not Maintained
**Symptoms**: Every query treated as new conversation
**Check**:
- Is conversationId persisting between queries?
- Are logs showing "No history - new conversation" for every query?
**Solution**: Verify conversationId state management in frontend

### Issue: Too Aggressive Context Retention
**Symptoms**: Unrelated queries still use old context
**Check**:
- Are explicit topic change phrases working?
**Solution**: Add more topic change phrases to the detection list

### Issue: Entity Extraction Failing
**Symptoms**: Patient names or tooth numbers not recognized
**Check**:
- Regex patterns in extractConversationContext()
- Message content format (capitalization, spacing)
**Solution**: Adjust regex patterns or add more entity types

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Build completed successfully
2. ‚è≥ Manual testing with the scenarios above
3. ‚è≥ Gather feedback on context retention quality
4. ‚è≥ Fine-tune topic detection thresholds if needed
5. ‚è≥ Add more entity types if required (procedures, medications, etc.)

## Example Log Output (Successful Context Retention)

```
üìÖ [APPOINTMENT INQUIRY AGENT] Processing query...
üÜï [TOPIC CHANGE] No history - new conversation
üéØ [ENDOFLOW MASTER] Intent classified: appointment_inquiry (95%)
‚úÖ [APPOINTMENT INQUIRY] Found 1 appointments
üì• [ENDOFLOW] Received result: {success: true, response: 'You have 1 appointment: Deepti Tomar...'}

[User says: "what treatment are we doing"]

‚û°Ô∏è [TOPIC CHANGE] Continuation indicator found: "what treatment" - treating as follow-up
üìù [CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT] Original: what treatment are we doing
üìù [CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT] Enhanced: what treatment are we doing for patient Deepti Tomar scheduled tomorrow
üéØ [ENDOFLOW MASTER] Intent classified: treatment_planning (85%)
KEY ENTITIES FROM CONVERSATION: Deepti Tomar, root canal, tomorrow
```

This shows:
1. First query establishes context (patient name extracted)
2. Second query recognized as follow-up (not new topic)
3. Context enhancement uses extracted patient name
4. Intent correctly classified with context
