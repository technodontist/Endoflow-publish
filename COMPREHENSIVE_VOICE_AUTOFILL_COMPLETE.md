## AI Prompt Enhancements

### Extraction Rules Added

**Medical History:**
- Extract medical conditions from conversational mentions
- Capture medication names with dosages
- Identify allergies from various phrasings
- Document previous dental work

**Personal History:**
- Smoking: "I smoke" / "pack a day" / "quit 2 years ago" ‚Üí status classification
- Alcohol: "drink socially" / "few beers a week" ‚Üí frequency classification  
- Tobacco: "chew tobacco" / "paan" / "betel nut" ‚Üí type identification
- Habits: "grind teeth" / "bite nails" / "clench jaw"
- Oral hygiene: "brush twice" / "don't floss" / "last cleaning was..."

**Clinical Examination:**
- Extraoral: "face is symmetric" / "TMJ clicking" / "swelling present"
- Intraoral: "see cavities" / "gums are inflamed" / "plaque buildup"
- Status assessments: "good hygiene" / "fair" / "poor"
- Gingival/periodontal conditions from clinical descriptions

### Confidence Scoring
- 90-100%: Clear, complete information with specific details
- 70-89%: Most key information present, some details missing
- 50-69%: Basic information present, many details missing
- 30-49%: Vague symptoms, limited information
- 0-29%: Very little relevant medical information extracted

## Mapping Dictionaries

### Medical Conditions
```typescript
'diabetes' ‚Üí 'Diabetes'
'hypertension'/'high blood pressure' ‚Üí 'Hypertension'
'heart disease'/'cardiac' ‚Üí 'Heart Disease'
'asthma' ‚Üí 'Asthma'
// ... more mappings
```

### Dietary Habits
```typescript
'high sugar'/'sweet' ‚Üí 'High sugar diet'
'frequent snack'/'snacking' ‚Üí 'Frequent snacking'
'carbonated'/'soda' ‚Üí 'Carbonated drinks'
// ... more mappings
```

### Clinical Findings
```typescript
'caries'/'cavit' ‚Üí 'Caries present'
'inflammation'/'inflamed' ‚Üí 'Gingival inflammation'
'plaque'/'calculus'/'tartar' ‚Üí 'Plaque / calculus'
// ... more mappings
```

## User Experience

### Visual Indicators
1. **AI Extraction Alert**: Purple gradient alert box at top of tab
2. **Confidence Badge**: Shows extraction confidence percentage
3. **Timestamp**: Displays when data was extracted
4. **Auto-checked Boxes**: Relevant checkboxes automatically selected
5. **Pre-filled Text**: Text areas populated with AI-extracted content

### Workflow
1. Dentist starts voice recording during consultation
2. AI processes transcript in real-time
3. After stopping recording, data automatically populates all relevant tabs
4. Dentist reviews and verifies auto-filled information
5. Makes corrections if needed
6. Saves consultation

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios

**Medical History:**
```
"Patient has diabetes and is on metformin 500mg twice daily. 
Allergic to penicillin. Had root canal treatment last year."
```
Expected: Diabetes checked, medication added, allergy noted, treatment logged

**Personal History:**
```
"I smoke about half a pack a day. Drink beer on weekends. 
Grind my teeth at night. Brush twice daily but don't floss."
```
Expected: Current smoker, occasional alcohol, teeth grinding, oral hygiene documented

**Clinical Examination:**
```
"Face looks symmetric. Some TMJ tenderness on the right.
Intraoral exam shows multiple caries. Gums are inflamed. 
Fair oral hygiene with plaque buildup."
```
Expected: TMJ tenderness checked, caries present, inflammation noted, fair hygiene selected

### Edge Cases
1. **Contradictory Information**: AI handles speech corrections
2. **Partial Information**: Fields left empty rather than guessing
3. **Multiple Mentions**: Deduplicates repeated information
4. **Informal Language**: Maps colloquial terms to medical terminology

## Performance Considerations

- **Token Usage**: Increased to 4096 tokens for comprehensive extraction
- **API Calls**: Single call extracts all data sections
- **Response Time**: Typically 2-4 seconds for full analysis
- **Fallback**: Keyword extraction if AI fails
- **Confidence Threshold**: 60% minimum for autofill

## Future Enhancements

1. **Semantic Time Understanding**: "few days ago" ‚Üí actual date calculation
2. **Treatment Effectiveness**: Extract information about treatment outcomes
3. **Multi-language Support**: Handle transcripts in different languages
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring medical patterns
5. **Drug Interaction Warnings**: Cross-reference medications with conditions
6. **Visual Confidence Indicators**: Color-coded fields based on extraction confidence
7. **Reprocess Option**: Allow users to reanalyze transcript with different parameters
8. **Field-level Confidence**: Show confidence per field rather than overall

## Known Limitations

1. **Context Dependency**: AI needs clear mentions, struggles with implied information
2. **Medical Terminology**: Works best with standard medical terms
3. **Multiple Speakers**: May confuse patient vs dentist statements
4. **Background Noise**: Speech recognition quality affects extraction
5. **Complex Histories**: Very detailed medical histories may be truncated
6. **Language Specificity**: Optimized for English, other languages not tested

## Maintenance Notes

### Updating Mappings
To add new checkbox options or improve mappings:
1. Update mapping dictionaries in `enhanced-new-consultation-v3.tsx`
2. Add examples to AI prompt in `medical-conversation-parser.ts`
3. Test with sample transcripts containing new terms
