# Contextual Appointment Integration — Handoff Summary

Location: D:\endoflow\endoflow3-main

Purpose
- Provide a clear handoff for the contextual appointment flow connecting consultations, planned treatments, and appointments.
- Make it easy for a new contributor/agent to continue work without re-discovering context.

Entry points and primary files
- Pages (route UIs)
  - app/dentist/contextual-appointment/page.tsx — Dentist entry
  - app/assistant/contextual-appointment/page.tsx — Assistant entry
- Core form component
  - components/appointments/ContextualAppointmentForm.tsx — main UI and client-side logic
- Server actions
  - lib/actions/contextual-appointments.ts — createContextualAppointment(payload)
- Related data sources (Supabase schema "api")
  - patients, dentists, consultations, treatments, appointments

What “Contextual Appointment” does
- Creates an appointment with additional context:
  - appointmentType: first_visit | consultation | treatment | follow_up
  - consultationId: required for treatment and follow_up
  - treatmentId: required for treatment
- For treatment: automatically bumps the linked treatment to In Progress (planned_status/status) upon appointment creation.

Recent improvements (this session)
- Clear patient context
  - Fetch and display the patient’s name at the top of the form after selection.
- Functional date/time inputs
  - Switched to native HTML inputs (type="date" and type="time"), default date = today, time = 10:00.
- Dentist selection
  - Replaced free-text dentist ID with a dentist dropdown populated from api.dentists; auto-selects first or provided default.
- Quick patient search on the contextual appointment pages
  - When no patient is selected, pages provide a debounced search by name (or paste patient UUID). Selecting a result loads the form.
- Minor validation feedback
  - Prevent submit when dentist/date/time are missing; show a simple message.

How it works (flow)
1) Entry into the page
   - Optional prefill via query params: ?patientId=...&dentistId=...
   - If patientId is absent, user can search by name or paste an ID.
2) Form behavior (ContextualAppointmentForm)
   - Shows patient name.
   - Loads dentists list and selects a default.
   - Appointment type controls extra fields:
     - treatment or follow_up ➜ show recent consultations for the patient.
     - treatment ➜ derive planned treatments from consultation.clinical_data.treatments where status is Planned/Pending.
   - User picks date/time/duration/notes.
3) Server action
   - createContextualAppointment(input) validates:
     - appointmentType required
     - consultationId required for treatment/follow_up
     - treatmentId required for treatment
   - Inserts into api.appointments with contextual fields consultation_id and treatment_id.
   - If appointmentType === 'treatment', updates api.treatments to In Progress.

Key assumptions and data model notes
- api.appointments has columns: patient_id, dentist_id, scheduled_date, scheduled_time, duration_minutes, appointment_type, status, notes, consultation_id (nullable), treatment_id (nullable).
- consultations.clinical_data (JSONB) may include treatments[] with fields like id/name/status; planned treatments detected by status/planned_status in ["planned", "pending"].
- RLS policies must allow the server action to write; createServiceClient uses a service role on the server.

How to run locally
- Ensure environment variables (.env.local or docker-compose) include:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (for server actions)
  - POSTGRES_URL, AUTH_SECRET (as per .env.example)
- Install and run:
  - pnpm install
  - pnpm dev
- Navigate:
  - Dentist: http://localhost:3000/dentist/contextual-appointment
  - Assistant: http://localhost:3000/assistant/contextual-appointment
  - Prefill example: /dentist/contextual-appointment?patientId={UUID}&dentistId={UUID}

Manual test checklist
- Search a patient by name on the page or paste a valid patient UUID.
- Confirm the patient name shows at the top of the form.
- Pick a dentist from the dropdown.
- Select date (today default) and time.
- Switch appointment type and verify conditional UI:
  - "treatment" or "follow_up": recent consultations list loads for that patient.
  - "treatment": planned treatment list appears for the selected consultation.
- Click "Create Contextual Appointment" and verify appointment is inserted and (for treatment) the treatment status moves to In Progress.

Known gaps / next steps
- Pass patientId automatically from prior patient selection (e.g., Patients tab or PatientSearchPanel) when navigating to contextual appointment. Current link: "Contextual Appointment" in app/dentist/page.tsx points to /dentist/contextual-appointment without context.
- Replace native date/time with a consistent popover calendar/time selector used elsewhere (optional UI refinement).
- Show scheduling conflicts and dentist availability inline (e.g., disable booked slots).
- Add success toast + redirect to the appointment’s context (e.g., patient timeline or dentist schedule).
- Extend status handling: add delivered/read-like indicators for appointment notifications if applicable.

Where to make changes
- UI/UX of the form: components/appointments/ContextualAppointmentForm.tsx
- Dentist/Assistant page search or routing changes:
  - app/dentist/contextual-appointment/page.tsx
  - app/assistant/contextual-appointment/page.tsx
- Server behavior/validation: lib/actions/contextual-appointments.ts

Quick troubleshooting
- Form doesn’t show dentists: ensure api.dentists has rows and RLS allows reads.
- Planned treatments list is empty: verify consultations.clinical_data.treatments contains items with status/planned_status Planned/Pending and matches the selected consultation.
- Insert fails: check console/server logs and confirm SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is set for server actions.

Owner’s recent intent
- Improve contextual appointment usability: show patient context, make date/time usable, prevent free-text dentist entry, and allow quick patient selection from the page.

This document should give a new agent enough context to continue with routing improvements (passing patient from previous pages), conflict/availability checks, and further UX polish.
