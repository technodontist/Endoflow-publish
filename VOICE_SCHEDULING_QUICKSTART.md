# Voice Scheduling Feature - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What's New?
AI-powered voice scheduling is now available in the appointment booking form! Just like the voice transcription feature in consultations, you can now speak naturally to schedule appointments.

## 📍 Where to Find It
Navigate to any appointment booking page and you'll see a **teal-colored voice recorder card** at the top of the form with the button **"Start Voice Scheduling"**.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Start Recording
Click the **"Start Voice Scheduling"** button (teal button with microphone icon)

### Step 2: Speak Naturally
Say your appointment details, for example:
```
"Schedule teeth cleaning for tomorrow at 2 PM"
```

Or more complex:
```
"Book urgent appointment for John Smith next Monday morning 
for root canal treatment. Patient has severe pain level 8."
```

### Step 3: Watch Real-Time Detection
As you speak, you'll see:
- 🎙️ Live transcript appearing
- 📊 AI detection badges showing what's being recognized:
  - Appointment Type Detected
  - Date Found
  - Time Found
  - Urgency Detected
  - Confidence Score

### Step 4: Stop Recording
Click the **"Stop"** button when you're done speaking

### Step 5: Auto-Fill Magic ✨
The AI will process your speech and automatically fill:
- ✅ Appointment date
- ✅ Appointment time
- ✅ Duration (based on appointment type)
- ✅ Notes (reason for visit)

You'll see a success message like:
```
✅ AI extracted appointment details with 85% confidence!
Teeth Cleaning on October 10, 2025 at 2:00 PM
```

### Step 6: Review & Submit
Review the auto-filled fields, make any adjustments, and submit!

## 💬 Example Voice Commands

### Simple Commands:
- "Schedule cleaning tomorrow at 2 PM"
- "Book checkup next Monday morning"
- "Appointment for Wednesday afternoon"

### With Details:
- "Schedule teeth cleaning for Sarah Johnson tomorrow at 3 PM"
- "Emergency appointment for severe tooth pain today at 5 PM"
- "Book 90-minute root canal with Dr. Smith on Friday at 2 PM"

## 🤖 Smart Features

### Natural Date Understanding:
- **"tomorrow"** - Next day
- **"next Monday"** - Upcoming Monday
- **"this Friday"** - This week's Friday
- **"October 15th"** - Specific date

### Time Flexibility:
- **"2 PM"** - Specific time
- **"morning"** - 9:00 AM
- **"afternoon"** - 2:00 PM
- **"evening"** - 5:00 PM

### Urgency Detection:
AI automatically detects urgency based on:
- Pain level mentions ("pain level 8 out of 10")
- Keywords ("emergency", "urgent", "ASAP")
- Severity descriptions ("severe pain", "can't eat")

## ⚡ Tips for Best Results

1. **Speak Clearly** - Normal pace, clear pronunciation
2. **Mention Key Details** - Type, date, time, patient name
3. **Be Specific** - "tomorrow at 2 PM" beats "sometime soon"
4. **Use Natural Language** - Talk like you normally would
5. **Quiet Environment** - Less background noise = better accuracy

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Microphone not working?**

**Poor transcription?**
