## Sample Treatment Procedures

### Root Canal Treatment (RCT)
**7 Detailed Steps:**
1. Patient Assessment & Diagnosis
2. Anesthesia Administration
3. Access Cavity Preparation
4. Working Length Determination
5. Biomechanical Preparation
6. Obturation
7. Post-Operative Care & Final Restoration

### Vital Pulp Therapy (VPT)
Includes material selection, indications, contraindications, and success factors.

### Pulpotomy
Step-by-step guide for coronal pulp removal procedures.

## Integration with RAG System

### Current Implementation (Demo Mode)
The current version uses **mock data** to demonstrate the interface and user experience.

### Future Enhancement (Production Mode)
To integrate with your actual RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system:

1. **Replace Mock Treatment Retrieval** (lines 94-122 in `self-learning-assistant.tsx`):
   ```typescript
   // Replace setTimeout with actual API call
   const result = await queryRAGSystem({
     query: searchQuery,
     type: 'treatment_options'
   })
   setTreatmentOptions(result.treatments)
   ```

2. **Replace Mock Step Generation** (lines 130-233):
   ```typescript
   // Replace setTimeout with actual RAG query
   const steps = await queryRAGSystem({
     treatment: treatmentName,
     type: 'step_by_step_guide'
   })
   setLearningSteps(steps)
   ```

3. **Replace Chat AI Response** (lines 261-333):
   ```typescript
   // Use actual RAG/LLM integration
   const aiResponse = await queryMedicalKnowledgeRAG({
     query: chatInput,
     context: 'treatment_procedures',
     useResearchPapers: true
   })
   ```

## API Integration Points

### Suggested Action Functions to Create:

```typescript
// lib/actions/self-learning.ts

export async function searchTreatmentOptionsAction(diagnosis: string) {
  // Query RAG system for treatments related to diagnosis
  // Return: { success: true, treatments: TreatmentOption[] }
}

export async function getTreatmentStepsAction(treatmentName: string) {
  // Query RAG system for step-by-step procedure
  // Return: { success: true, steps: LearningStep[] }
}

export async function askTreatmentQuestionAction(question: string) {
  // Query RAG/LLM with medical knowledge context
  // Return: { success: true, answer: string, sources: string[] }
}
```

### Required Database Queries:

The RAG system should query the `medical_knowledge` table with:
- **diagnosis_keywords**: To find relevant papers for diagnosis search
- **treatment_keywords**: To find treatment protocols
- **content**: To extract step-by-step procedures
- **topics**: To filter by specialty

## Benefits

1. **Continuous Learning**: Dentists can learn new procedures at their own pace
2. **Evidence-Based**: All guidance comes from uploaded research papers
3. **Step-by-Step Clarity**: Complex procedures broken down into manageable steps
4. **Interactive**: Ask specific questions and get targeted answers
5. **Safety-Focused**: Warnings and contraindications clearly highlighted
6. **Practice-Ready**: Practical tips from clinical experience
