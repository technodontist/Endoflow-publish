## Database Design & Data Security

### **HIPAA-Compliant Database Architecture**

#### **🔒 Row-Level Security (RLS) Implementation**

```sql
-- Patient Data Access Control
CREATE POLICY "patients_own_data" ON api.consultations
FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (
  patient_id = auth.uid() OR
  dentist_id = auth.uid() OR
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid() 
    AND role IN ('dentist', 'assistant') 
    AND status = 'active'
  )
);

-- AI Knowledge Access (Dentists Only)
CREATE POLICY "dentists_medical_knowledge" ON api.medical_knowledge
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid() 
    AND role = 'dentist' 
    AND status = 'active'
  )
);

-- Assistant Operational Data
CREATE POLICY "assistants_operational_access" ON api.appointments
FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid() 
    AND role IN ('dentist', 'assistant') 
    AND status = 'active'
  )
);
```

#### **📡 Subscription Management**

**Patient Dashboard Subscriptions**:
```typescript
// Real-time appointment updates
const appointmentSubscription = supabase
  .channel(`appointments:${patientId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'api',
    table: 'appointments',
    filter: `patient_id=eq.${patientId}`
  }, (payload) => {
    updateAppointmentUI(payload)
    showNotification('Appointment updated')
  })
  .subscribe()

// Real-time message notifications
const messageSubscription = supabase
  .channel(`messages:${patientId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: 'INSERT',
    schema: 'api', 
    table: 'thread_messages',
    filter: `thread_id=in.(${patientThreadIds.join(',')})`
  }, (payload) => {
    displayNewMessage(payload.new)
    playNotificationSound()
  })
  .subscribe()
```

**Dentist Dashboard Subscriptions**:
```typescript
// Patient file updates
const fileSubscription = supabase
  .channel('patient_files')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'api',
    table: 'patient_files'
  }, (payload) => {
    if (payload.eventType === 'INSERT') {
      refreshFileList()
      showNotification(`New file uploaded: ${payload.new.filename}`)
    }
  })
  .subscribe()

// AI suggestion updates
const aiSubscription = supabase
  .channel('ai_suggestions')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: 'INSERT',

## Performance Optimization

### **System Performance Architecture**

#### **🚀 Application Performance**

**Frontend Optimization**:
```typescript
// Code splitting for dashboard routes
const PatientDashboard = lazy(() => import('./patient/Dashboard'))
const DentistDashboard = lazy(() => import('./dentist/Dashboard'))
const AssistantDashboard = lazy(() => import('./assistant/Dashboard'))

// Component memoization for expensive renders
const MemoizedFDIChart = React.memo(FDIChart, (prev, next) => {
  return prev.selectedTooth === next.selectedTooth &&
         prev.diagnosis === next.diagnosis
})

// Virtual scrolling for large patient lists
const VirtualizedPatientList = ({ patients }) => {
  return (
    <FixedSizeList
      height={600}
      itemCount={patients.length}
      itemSize={80}
      itemData={patients}
    >
      {PatientRow}
    </FixedSizeList>
  )
}
```

**Backend Performance**:
```typescript
// Server action caching
export const getPatientConsultations = cache(async (patientId: string) => {
  const result = await supabase
    .from('consultations')
    .select('*')
    .eq('patient_id', patientId)
    .order('consultation_date', { ascending: false })
    .limit(50) // Pagination
    
  return result
})

// Database query optimization
const optimizedQuery = `
  SELECT 
    c.*,
    d.full_name as dentist_name,
    COUNT(t.id) as treatment_count
  FROM api.consultations c
  LEFT JOIN api.dentists d ON c.dentist_id = d.id
  LEFT JOIN api.treatments t ON c.id = t.consultation_id
  WHERE c.patient_id = $1
  GROUP BY c.id, d.full_name
  ORDER BY c.consultation_date DESC
  LIMIT 25
`
```

#### **🤖 AI Performance Optimization**

**Vector Search Performance**:
```sql
-- Optimized vector similarity search
SELECT 
  mk.*,
  (1 - (mk.embedding <=> $1)) as similarity_score
FROM api.medical_knowledge mk
WHERE 1 - (mk.embedding <=> $1) > 0.7  -- Similarity threshold
  AND mk.specialty = ANY($2)           -- Filter by specialty
  AND mk.topics && $3                  -- Tag intersection
ORDER BY mk.embedding <=> $1
LIMIT 5;

-- Index usage: IVFFlat + GIN composite
-- Performance: <100ms for 10,000+ documents
```

**AI Response Caching**:
```typescript
// Multi-layer caching strategy
interface CacheStrategy {
  // Level 1: Memory cache (1 minute)
  memory: Map<string, CachedResponse>
  
  // Level 2: Database cache (7 days)
  database: 'ai_suggestion_cache'
  
  // Level 3: Redis cache (24 hours)
  redis: RedisClient
}

const getCachedAISuggestion = async (diagnosisKey: string) => {
  // Check memory first
  if (memoryCache.has(diagnosisKey)) {
    return memoryCache.get(diagnosisKey)
  }
  
  // Check database cache
  const dbCache = await supabase
    .from('ai_suggestion_cache')
    .select('*')
    .eq('diagnosis_key', diagnosisKey)
    .gt('expires_at', new Date().toISOString())
    .single()
    
  if (dbCache.data) {
    memoryCache.set(diagnosisKey, dbCache.data)
    return dbCache.data
  }
  
  // Generate new suggestion
  return await generateAISuggestion(diagnosisKey)
}
```

#### **📊 Performance Monitoring**

**Key Performance Indicators**:
- **Page Load Time**: <2 seconds (95th percentile)
- **API Response Time**: <300ms average
- **AI Suggestion Speed**: <3 seconds (cached), <8 seconds (new)
- **Database Query Time**: <50ms average
- **Real-time Message Latency**: <200ms

**Monitoring Dashboard**:
```typescript
// Performance metrics collection
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  pageLoadTime: number
  apiResponseTime: number
  aiSuggestionTime: number
  databaseQueryTime: number
  errorRate: number
  userSessionDuration: number
}

// Real-time performance tracking
const trackPerformance = (metric: keyof PerformanceMetrics, value: number) => {
  // Send to analytics
  analytics.track('performance_metric', {
    metric,
    value,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    userId: getCurrentUser()?.id,
    userRole: getCurrentUser()?.role

## Troubleshooting & Maintenance

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **🔧 Technical Issues**

**AI Response Issues**:
```
Problem: "No relevant medical knowledge found"
Causes:
- Insufficient knowledge base content
- High similarity threshold (>0.7)
- Missing diagnosis keywords

Solutions:
1. Upload more medical literature
2. Lower threshold to 0.5-0.6
3. Improve content tagging
4. Check embedding generation

Diagnostic Commands:
-- Check knowledge base size
SELECT COUNT(*), specialty FROM api.medical_knowledge GROUP BY specialty;

-- Test vector search
SELECT * FROM search_treatment_protocols(
  generate_embedding('irreversible pulpitis'),
  ARRAY['irreversible_pulpitis'],
  ARRAY['rct'],
  'endodontics',
  0.5,
  5
);
```

**Database Performance Issues**:
```sql
-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT 
  query,
  mean_exec_time,
  calls,
  total_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check index usage
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  indexname,
  idx_tup_read,
  idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_tup_read > 0;

-- Analyze table statistics
ANALYZE api.consultations;
ANALYZE api.medical_knowledge;
```

#### **🛠️ Maintenance Procedures**

**Daily Tasks (Automated)**:
- Database backup verification
- Performance metric collection
- Error log analysis
- AI cache cleanup (expired entries)
- Security scan reports

**Weekly Tasks**:
- Knowledge base updates (new research papers)
- Performance optimization review
- User feedback analysis
- System resource utilization check
- Backup restoration testing

**Monthly Tasks**:
- Comprehensive security audit
- Database optimization and reindexing
- AI model performance evaluation
- HIPAA compliance verification
- Disaster recovery testing

#### **📊 System Monitoring**

**Health Check Endpoints**:
```typescript
// API health monitoring
GET /api/health
Response: {
  status: "healthy",
  database: "connected",
  ai_services: "operational",
  response_time: 150,
  timestamp: "2025-10-10T16:15:32Z"
}

// Detailed system status
GET /api/status
Response: {
  application: {
    version: "2.1.0",
    uptime: 2592000, // seconds
    memory_usage: "2.1GB",
    cpu_usage: "23%"
  },
  database: {
    connections: 45,
    response_time: "12ms",
    storage_used: "67%"
  },
  ai_services: {
    openai_status: "operational",
    gemini_status: "operational",
    cache_hit_rate: "78%",
    avg_response_time: "3.2s"
  }
}
