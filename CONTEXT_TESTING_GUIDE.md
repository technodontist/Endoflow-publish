## 🎯 Test Scenarios (Copy & Paste These!)

### **Test 1: Patient List Follow-up** ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT

```
First message: "Find patients with RCT"
Wait for response...

Follow-up: "Name them"
```

**What to Check:**
- ✅ AI should understand "them" = patients with RCT
- ✅ Should list patient names without asking "which patients?"
- 📝 Check console for: `[CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT] Original: "Name them"`

---

### **Test 2: Pronoun Resolution**

```
First message: "Tell me about patient John Doe"
Wait for response...

Follow-up: "Schedule RCT for him tomorrow at 2 PM"
```

**What to Check:**
- ✅ AI should resolve "him" = "John Doe"
- ✅ Should attempt to book appointment for John Doe
- 📝 Check console for: `[CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT] Enhanced: "Schedule RCT appointment for patient John Doe..."`

---

### **Test 3: Treatment Count Follow-up**

```
First message: "How many RCT treatments did I do last month?"
Wait for response...

Follow-up: "Who were the patients?"
```

**What to Check:**
- ✅ AI should understand "patients" refers to RCT cases from last month
- ✅ Should list patient names without confusion
- 📝 Check console for context enhancement

---

### **Test 4: Schedule Follow-up**

```
First message: "What's my schedule today?"
Wait for response...

Follow-up: "How many patients?"
```

**What to Check:**
- ✅ AI should understand "patients" refers to today's appointments
- ✅ Should provide count of today's patients
- 📝 Check console logs

---

### **Test 5: Treatment Details Follow-up**

```
First message: "Suggest treatment for pulpitis on tooth 46"
Wait for response...

Follow-up: "What are the contraindications?"
```

**What to Check:**
- ✅ AI should understand referring to pulpitis/tooth 46 treatment
- ✅ Should provide specific contraindications
- 📝 Check console for query enhancement

---

## 🔍 How to Check Console Logs

### **In Chrome/Edge:**
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Click **"Console"** tab
3. Look for these messages:

```
📝 [CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT] Original: "Name them"
📝 [CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT] Enhanced: "Provide detailed information..."

🔬 [CLINICAL RESEARCH AGENT] Processing query...
```

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

### **The feature is working if you see:**

1. **Follow-up questions work naturally**
   - "Name them" after "Find patients..."
   - "Schedule for him" after asking about a patient
   - "Who were they" after a count query

2. **Console shows context enhancement**
   - Original query shown
   - Enhanced query shown (with pronouns resolved)

3. **No "Please specify" errors**
   - AI doesn't ask "Which patients?" when context is clear
   - AI doesn't ask "Who?" when pronoun was just mentioned

---

## ❌ If Something's Wrong

### **Problem: Follow-up doesn't work**

**Check:**
1. Are you using the same conversation? (Don't refresh page)
2. Is console showing context enhancement logs?
3. Any errors in console?

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're asking follow-up in same chat session
- Check browser console for error messages
- Try refreshing and testing again

---

### **Problem: Build errors**

**Check:**
```powershell
npm run build
```

**If errors appear:**
- Something went wrong with implementation
- Share error message for debugging

---

## 🎨 Visual Confirmation

### **What You Should See:**

#### **Before Context Feature:**
```
You: "Find RCT patients"
AI: "Found 5 patients"

You: "Name them"
AI: "❌ Please specify which patients you're asking about"
```

#### **After Context Feature (Now):**
```
You: "Find RCT patients"
AI: "Found 5 patients: John, Maria, Sarah..."

You: "Name them"
AI: "✅ Here are the details:
     1. John Doe - Age 42, tooth 36
     2. Maria Garcia - Age 35, tooth 46
     ..."
```

## 🐛 Known Issues (Expected Behavior)

1. **Long conversations:** After many messages, older context may be lost (last 3 messages only)
2. **Topic changes:** If you suddenly change topic, AI might still use old context
3. **Complex pronouns:** "They" with multiple referents might confuse AI

These are limitations, not bugs. Phase 2 would address them.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing

If tests pass:
1. ✅ Mark Phase 1 as COMPLETE
2. 📋 Decide if Phase 2 (topic detection) is needed
3. 🎉 Start using natural follow-up conversations!

If tests fail:
1. 📝 Document which scenarios failed
2. 🔍 Check console logs for errors
3. 💬 Report findings for debugging

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use natural language:** Talk like you'd talk to a real assistant
2. **Keep it conversational:** Ask follow-ups naturally
3. **Watch the console:** Console logs tell you what's happening
4. **Same session:** Make sure not to refresh between questions
