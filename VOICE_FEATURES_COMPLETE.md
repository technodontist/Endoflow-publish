### 3. ‚úÖ Component Updates

#### `components/dentist/self-learning-assistant.tsx`

**Added Imports:**
```typescript
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import { useSpeechRecognition } from '@/lib/hooks/use-speech-recognition'
import { useTextToSpeech } from '@/lib/hooks/use-text-to-speech'
import { Mic, MicOff, Volume2, Pause, Square } from 'lucide-react'
```

**Hook Initialization (Line 156-166):**
```typescript
// Voice features
const speechRecognition = useSpeechRecognition({
  continuous: false,
  interimResults: true,
  onResult: (transcript) => {
    setChatInput(transcript)
  }
})

const textToSpeech = useTextToSpeech()
const [speakingMessageIndex, setSpeakingMessageIndex] = useState<number | null>(null)
```

**Message Rendering (Line 1354-1416):**
- AI messages now use `<ReactMarkdown>` with `remarkGfm` plugin
- User messages remain plain text
- Each AI message has TTS control buttons:
  - **Listen/Pause Button**: Start or pause speech
  - **Stop Button**: Stop speech (only visible when speaking)
  - Dynamic button text and icons based on state

**Voice Input Form (Line 1441-1501):**
- Microphone button toggles voice recording
- Visual feedback with pulsing red dot during recording
- Live interim transcript display
- Voice input populates the text field
- Disabled during message submission

### 4. ‚úÖ Markdown Styling

#### `app/globals.css` (Line 270-368)

Added comprehensive `.prose` styles:
- **Typography**: Styled headings (h1-h4), paragraphs, emphasis
- **Lists**: Proper indentation for ul/ol with good spacing
- **Code**: Inline code with gray background, code blocks with dark theme
- **Links**: Teal color scheme matching app theme
- **Blockquotes**: Left border with italic text
- **Tables**: Full-width with borders and headers
- **Colors**: Gray scale with teal accents

## User Experience Flow

### Speech-to-Text (Voice Input)
1. User clicks microphone button
2. Browser prompts for mic permission (first time)
3. Red pulsing dot indicates active listening
4. User speaks their question
5. Interim transcript shows partial text (live preview)
6. Final transcript fills input field
7. User clicks Send or speaks again

### Text-to-Speech (Voice Output)
1. AI response appears with "Listen" button
2. User clicks "Listen"
3. Browser reads message aloud (markdown cleaned)
4. Button changes to "Pause"
5. User can pause/resume or stop
6. Only one message speaks at a time

### Markdown Rendering
1. AI responses automatically formatted
2. Bold text, lists, headings render properly
3. No more raw asterisks or hash marks
4. Code blocks with syntax highlighting
5. Tables and blockquotes styled
6. Professional, readable presentation
