# Automated Hands-Free Conversation Mode

## Overview

EndoFlow AI now features a **fully automated, hands-free conversation mode** that allows dentists to have natural conversations without clicking any buttons. The system intelligently detects when you've finished speaking and automatically submits your query.

## Features

### ü§ñ **Auto Mode (Default)**

When Auto Mode is enabled (purple "Auto" button in header), the system:

1. **Listens continuously** - No need to stop/start manually
2. **Detects silence** - Auto-submits after 2 seconds of silence
3. **Recognizes command phrases** - Instant submission on trigger words
4. **Continues conversation** - Automatically listens for next query after AI responds
5. **Fully hands-free** - Zero clicking required during conversation

### üé§ **Manual Mode**

When Auto Mode is disabled, the system works like before:
- Click mic button to start/stop
- Click send button to submit
- Manual control over every action

## How It Works

### 1. Wake Word Activation

```
You: "Hey EndoFlow"
‚Üí Chat expands automatically
‚Üí Mic starts listening automatically
‚Üí Ready for your query
```

### 2. Silence Detection

```
You: "Show me today's appointments"
‚Üí [2 seconds of silence]
‚Üí Auto-submits query automatically
‚Üí AI processes and responds
‚Üí AI speaks response (if voice enabled)
‚Üí Automatically starts listening for next query
```

### 3. Command Phrase Triggers

Say any of these phrases to immediately submit:

| Command Phrase | Example Usage |
|---------------|---------------|
| `do it` | "Find patients with RCT, **do it**" |
| `search it` | "Show appointments for tomorrow, **search it**" |
| `send it` | "Book appointment for John at 3pm, **send it**" |
| `go ahead` | "What's my schedule, **go ahead**" |
| `execute` | "Find patient Sarah's records, **execute**" |
| `submit` | "Show treatment plans, **submit**" |
| `find it` | "Patients from last month, **find it**" |
| `show me` | "**Show me** all pending cases" |
| `that's it` | "Look for tooth 36 RCT, **that's it**" |
| `done` | "Check today's revenue, **done**" |
| `okay go` | "Schedule for next week, **okay go**" |
| `ok go` | "Find Dr. Smith's patients, **ok go**" |

### 4. Continuous Conversation

```
Full conversation flow:

You: "Hey EndoFlow"
[Auto-activates]

You: "What's my schedule today?"
[Auto-submits after 2s silence]
AI: "You have 5 appointments today..."
[AI speaks response]
[Auto-starts listening]

You: "Show me the first appointment"
[Auto-submits]
AI: "Your first appointment is with John Doe at 9:00 AM..."
[Auto-starts listening]

You: "Book a follow-up for him next week"

#### Bottom Status Bar
- **Auto Mode ON**: `ü§ñ Auto mode: Speak naturally - I'll submit after 2s silence or command phrases`
- **Auto Mode OFF**: `üé§ Speak clearly: Ask about patients, schedule, treatments, or anything else`

## Technical Details

### Silence Detection Algorithm

```typescript
// Track last speech time
lastSpeechTimeRef.current = Date.now()

// When final transcript is received
if (finalTranscript) {
  lastSpeechTimeRef.current = Date.now()
  resetSilenceTimer()
}

// Timer checks after 2 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  const silenceDuration = Date.now() - lastSpeechTimeRef.current
  if (silenceDuration >= 2000 && transcript.length > 0) {
    autoSubmit()
  }
}, 2000)
```

### Command Phrase Detection

```typescript
const commandPhrases = [
  'do it', 'search it', 'send it',
  'go ahead', 'execute', 'submit',
  'find it', 'show me', "that's it",
  'done', 'okay go', 'ok go'
]

// Check if transcript contains any command phrase
const hasCommandPhrase = commandPhrases.some(phrase => {
  const regex = new RegExp(`\\b${phrase}\\b`, 'i')
  return regex.test(fullText)
})

if (hasCommandPhrase) {
  // Auto-submit after 500ms delay
  setTimeout(() => autoSubmit(), 500)
}
```

### Auto-Restart After Response

```typescript
// After AI speaks response
if (autoMode && synthRef.current) {
  // Wait for speech to end
  const checkSpeechEnd = setInterval(() => {
    if (!synthRef.current?.speaking) {
      clearInterval(checkSpeechEnd)
      // Restart listening after 1 second
      setTimeout(() => {
        startVoiceRecording()
      }, 1000)
    }
  }, 100)
}
```

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Quick Schedule Check
```
Dentist: "Hey EndoFlow"
[Activates]

Dentist: "What's my schedule today"
[2s silence ‚Üí auto-submits]

AI: "You have 5 appointments today. First is John at 9am..."
[Speaks and auto-restarts]

Dentist: "That's all, thanks"
[2s silence ‚Üí processes]
```

### Scenario 2: Patient Search with Commands
```
Dentist: "Hey EndoFlow"
[Activates]

Dentist: "Find patients with RCT on tooth 36, search it"
[Instantly submits on "search it"]

AI: "I found 3 patients with RCT on tooth 36..."
[Auto-restarts]
```

### Scenario 3: Appointment Booking
```
Dentist: "Hey EndoFlow"
Dentist: "Book appointment for Sarah Johnson tomorrow at 3pm, do it"
[Instantly submits on "do it"]

AI: "I've scheduled an appointment for Sarah Johnson..."
[Auto-restarts]

Dentist: "Send her a reminder, go ahead"
[Instantly submits on "go ahead"]
```

## Benefits

### For Dentists
‚úÖ **Zero clicking** - Completely hands-free operation  
‚úÖ **Natural conversation** - Speak as you would to a human assistant  
‚úÖ **Faster workflow** - No need to reach for mouse/keyboard  
‚úÖ **Multitasking** - Keep hands on instruments or patient care  
‚úÖ **Intuitive** - Works like talking to a real assistant  

### For Practice Efficiency
‚úÖ **Increased productivity** - Faster task completion  
‚úÖ **Reduced interruptions** - No breaking away to click buttons  
‚úÖ **Better ergonomics** - Less repetitive clicking  
‚úÖ **More natural documentation** - Speak naturally while working  

## Settings & Customization

### Toggle Auto Mode
Click the purple "Auto" button in the header to toggle between:
- **Auto Mode** (Purple) - Fully automated
- **Manual Mode** (Gray) - Traditional click-to-submit

### Adjust Silence Threshold
Currently set to **2 seconds** (optimal for natural speech pauses)

Can be customized in code:
```typescript
// In resetSilenceTimer function
silenceTimerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
  // ... check logic
}, 2000) // Change this value (in milliseconds)
```

### Add Custom Command Phrases
```typescript
const commandPhrases = [
  'do it',
  'search it',
  // Add your custom phrases here:
  'please proceed',
  'make it so',
  'continue'
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Auto-submit happens too quickly
**Solution**: Natural speech has pauses. The 2-second threshold accounts for this. If triggering too early, you might be using command phrases unintentionally.

### Issue: Auto-submit doesn't work
**Solutions**:
1. Check if Auto Mode is enabled (purple "Auto" button)
2. Ensure you're speaking loud enough for mic to detect
3. Check microphone permissions
4. Look for console logs: `üîá [AUTO MODE] 2s silence detected`

### Issue: Command phrases not recognized
**Solutions**:
1. Speak the command phrase clearly at the end
2. Check browser console for phrase detection logs
3. Ensure phrase is in the command list (case-insensitive)

### Issue: Doesn't restart after AI response
**Solutions**:
1. Check if voice responses are enabled
2. Wait for AI to finish speaking
3. Check console for: `üîÑ [AUTO MODE] Restarting listening`

## Console Log Indicators

| Log | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `ü§ñ [AUTO MODE] Auto-submitting query` | Auto-submit triggered |
| `üîá [AUTO MODE] 2s silence detected` | Silence timer completed |
| `‚ú® [AUTO MODE] Command phrase detected` | Trigger word recognized |
| `‚è≥ [AUTO MODE] Waiting for AI response` | Processing query |
| `üîÑ [AUTO MODE] Restarting listening` | Auto-restart activated |

## Best Practices

### 1. Speak Naturally
- Don't rush - the system waits 2 seconds for natural pauses
- Speak at normal pace
- Use command phrases for quick actions

### 2. Use Command Phrases Strategically
- End urgent queries with "do it" or "search it"
- Use "show me" at the start for immediate display commands
- Say "that's it" when you've finished a complex query

### 3. Combine with Wake Word
```
"Hey EndoFlow, what's my schedule today"
[Automatically processes everything]
```

### 4. Multi-step Conversations
```
"Hey EndoFlow"
"Find patient John Doe"
[Wait for response]
"Show his treatment history"
[Wait for response]
"Book a follow-up, do it"
```
