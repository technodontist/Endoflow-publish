# Diagnosis Checkbox Auto-Tick Fix

## Problem
When a diagnosis was made via voice recognition, it would:
- ✅ Update the FDI chart color/status
- ✅ Show in the diagnosis overview tab
- ❌ **NOT auto-tick the diagnosis checkboxes** when opening the Clinical Record dialog

## Root Cause
The voice recognition was saving diagnosis names that didn't exactly match the predefined options in the dialog:
- Voice saved: `"Deep dental caries"`
- Dialog expects: `"Deep Caries"`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Diagnosis Name Normalization in Dialog
**File**: `components/dentist/tooth-diagnosis-dialog-v2.tsx`

Added a `normalizeDiagnosisName()` function that:
- Maps common variations to exact predefined diagnosis names
- Handles cases like "Deep dental caries" → "Deep Caries"
- Falls back to capitalizing unknown diagnoses

**Mappings include:**
```typescript
'deep dental caries' → 'Deep Caries'
'dental caries' → 'Moderate Caries'
'periapical abscess' → 'Apical Abscess'
'tooth fracture' → 'Crown Fracture (Enamel-Dentin)'
'pulpal involvement' → 'Irreversible Pulpitis'
// ... and more
```

### 2. Updated Voice Recognition to Use Exact Names
**File**: `app/api/voice/process-global-transcript/route.ts`

Changed the voice recognition to save diagnoses using the exact names from the predefined list:
- ✅ `'Deep Caries'` (was: "Deep dental caries")
- ✅ `'Apical Abscess'` (was: "Periapical abscess")
- ✅ `'Irreversible Pulpitis'` (was: "Pulpal involvement")
- ✅ `'Root Canal Treatment'` (exact match with treatment options)
- ✅ `'Composite Filling'` (exact match with treatment options)

## Changes Made

### Dialog Component (`tooth-diagnosis-dialog-v2.tsx`)
- Added normalization function before setting diagnoses
- Logs normalized diagnoses for debugging
- Ensures checkboxes auto-tick correctly

### Voice Processing API (`process-global-transcript/route.ts`)
- Updated all diagnosis strings to match predefined options
- Added more specific caries detection (incipient, moderate, deep, rampant, root, recurrent)
- Added pulpitis detection (reversible, irreversible)
- Added necrosis, gingivitis, periodontitis detection
- Updated treatment names to exact matches

## Result
Now when voice recognition creates a diagnosis:
1. ✅ FDI chart updates with correct color/status
2. ✅ Diagnosis overview shows the diagnosis
3. ✅ **Opening the Clinical Record dialog auto-ticks the diagnosis checkbox**
4. ✅ Treatment suggestions also match predefined options

## Testing
To test:
1. Start a voice session in a consultation
2. Say something like: "The patient has deep caries in tooth 47"
3. Stop the voice session
4. Observe: FDI chart shows tooth 47 colored for caries
5. Click on tooth 47 to open Clinical Record dialog
6. ✅ **"Deep Caries" checkbox should be automatically ticked**

## Files Modified
1. `components/dentist/tooth-diagnosis-dialog-v2.tsx` - Added normalization
2. `app/api/voice/process-global-transcript/route.ts` - Updated diagnosis names

## Notes
- The normalization function is defensive - it handles both old and new format
- If a diagnosis doesn't match any known pattern, it's still displayed (capitalized)
- This ensures backward compatibility with existing data
