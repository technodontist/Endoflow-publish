# Date of Birth Implementation in Self-Signup

## Summary
Added optional Date of Birth field to the patient self-signup flow to address the issue where many patients were registering without DOB/age information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Form Component
**File:** `components/patient-registration-form-simple.tsx`

- Added `dateOfBirth: string` to the `PatientRegistrationData` interface
- Added `dateOfBirth: ""` to the initial form state
- Added Date of Birth input field in Step 1 (Personal Information):
  - Type: HTML5 date picker
  - Status: Optional field
  - Max date: Today (prevents future dates)
  - Helper text: "Helps us provide better age-appropriate care"

### 2. Signup Page
**File:** `app/signup/page.tsx`

- Updated the `patientSignup` call to include `dateOfBirth: data.dateOfBirth`
- Passes the DOB from form data to the backend action

### 3. Backend Action
**File:** `lib/actions/patient-signup.ts`

- Updated `PatientSignupData` interface to include `dateOfBirth?: string` (optional)
- Modified patient record creation to conditionally include DOB:
  - If `formData.dateOfBirth` is provided, it's saved to `api.patients.date_of_birth`
  - Added console logging to track when DOB is included
  - If empty/not provided, the field is omitted (remains NULL in database)

## Database Field
- **Table:** `api.patients`
- **Column:** `date_of_birth`
- **Type:** DATE (or similar)
- **Status:** Optional/nullable

## Flow Comparison

### Before
**Self-Signup:** First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Password → ❌ No DOB
**Assistant Registration:** First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, DOB (optional), Medical History, Emergency Contact → ✅ DOB supported

### After
**Self-Signup:** First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, **DOB (optional)**, Password → ✅ DOB supported
**Assistant Registration:** First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, DOB (optional), Medical History, Emergency Contact → ✅ DOB supported

## User Experience
- DOB field appears on Step 1 (Personal Information) of the self-signup flow
- It's optional, so patients can skip it if they prefer
- HTML5 date picker provides native UX on all platforms
- Max date validation prevents invalid future dates
- Helper text explains the benefit of providing DOB

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Self-signup with DOB provided → DOB saved to database
- [ ] Self-signup without DOB (left empty) → NULL in database, no errors
- [ ] Date picker max date validation works (can't select future dates)
- [ ] Form submission works normally in both cases
- [ ] Assistant registration flow still works with existing DOB field
- [ ] Existing patients without DOB remain unaffected

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Display age calculation:** Calculate and display patient age from DOB in profiles/dashboards
2. **Make DOB required:** If medically necessary, change validation to require DOB
3. **Age-based features:** Implement age-appropriate care reminders or treatment suggestions
4. **Bulk update:** Create admin tool to request DOB from existing patients without it
