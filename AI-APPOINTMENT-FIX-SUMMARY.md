# AI-Scheduled Appointment Treatment Completion Fix

## Problem Identified

When completing appointments scheduled by AI (via voice commands), the tooth status was incorrectly being set to "healthy" (green) instead of the appropriate treatment status (e.g., "root_canal" → orange).

### Root Cause

AI-scheduled appointments had several issues:

1. **Generic appointment type**: `appointment_type = "treatment"` instead of specific type like "Root Canal Treatment"
2. **Treatment info in notes**: The actual treatment details were buried in the notes field:
   - Example: `"AI-scheduled: set up an appointment for patient name Deepti Tomar for root canal treatment in the tooth number 46 at 11 a.m. tomorrow"`
3. **No tooth linkage**: Treatments were not linked to `tooth_diagnosis_id` or `tooth_number`
4. **Incomplete diagnosis data**: Tooth diagnosis records had `primary_diagnosis = "null"`

### Example from Logs

```
🦷 [TREATMENTS] Starting tooth status update:
  📅 Appointment Status: completed
  🔧 Treatment Type: treatment          ← Generic!
  🦷 Current Diagnosis Status: undefined
  🎯 New Tooth Status: healthy          ← Wrong!
  🎨 Color Code: #22c55e               ← Green instead of orange
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Treatment Type Detection

Added multi-source treatment type detection in `lib/actions/treatments.ts`:

```typescript
// Priority order:
1. treatment.treatment_type (if specific)
2. tooth_diagnosis.recommended_treatment (from linked diagnosis)
3. appointment.notes (extract from AI text)
4. appointment.appointment_type (fallback)
```

### 2. Extract from AI Notes

Parse appointment notes to extract treatment type:

```typescript
const notes = appointment.notes.toLowerCase()

if (notes.includes('root canal') || notes.includes(' rct ')) {
  treatmentType = 'Root Canal Treatment'
} else if (notes.includes('filling')) {
  treatmentType = 'Composite Filling'
} else if (notes.includes('pulpotomy')) {
  treatmentType = 'Pulpotomy'
}
// ... etc
```

### 3. Extract Tooth Number from Notes

When tooth_number is not linked, extract from notes:

```typescript
// Matches: "tooth number 46", "tooth 46", "#46", "in 46"
const toothMatch = notes.match(/(?:tooth\s*(?:number\s*)?|#)(\d{1,2})/i)
if (toothMatch) {
  toothNumber = toothMatch[1]
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Status Mapping

Updated `lib/utils/toothStatus.ts` to recognize more patterns:

- **Root canal indicators**: "pulpitis", "root treatment", "rct"
- **Diagnosis-based inference**: "deep caries" → likely RCT
- **Treatment verbs**: "restore", "extract", "remove"

### 5. Multiple Update Fallbacks

Try multiple methods to find and update the tooth:

1. Direct `tooth_diagnosis_id` (if linked)
2. `consultation_id` + `tooth_number`
3. **NEW**: `patient_id` + `tooth_number` (latest diagnosis)
4. `appointment_teeth` table lookup

## Files Modified

### lib/actions/treatments.ts
- Enhanced `updateToothStatusForAppointmentStatus()` function
- Added notes parsing for treatment type extraction
- Added tooth number extraction from notes
- Added patient_id + tooth_number fallback

### lib/utils/toothStatus.ts
- Enhanced `mapFinalStatusFromTreatment()` with more keywords
- Added diagnosis-based inference logic
- Added treatment verb recognition

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before
```
AI: "schedule RCT for tooth 46 tomorrow"
→ Appointment created with type="treatment"
→ Completed → Status="healthy" (green)
❌ Wrong!
```

### After
```
AI: "schedule RCT for tooth 46 tomorrow"
→ Appointment created with type="treatment", notes="...rct...tooth 46..."
→ System extracts: treatment="Root Canal Treatment", tooth="46"
→ Completed → Status="root_canal" (orange)
✅ Correct!
```

## Testing

### Test Case: Tooth #46 RCT

**Before Fix:**
- Appointment notes: "root canal treatment in the tooth number 46"
- Treatment type: "treatment"
- Result: Status="healthy", Color=green

**After Fix:**
- Extracts treatment: "Root Canal Treatment"
- Extracts tooth: "46"
- Result: Status="root_canal", Color=orange

### Test Commands

```bash
# Check appointment data
node check-appointment-data.mjs

# View logs when completing appointment
# Look for:
#   📝 Extracted from notes: "Root Canal Treatment"
#   🦷 Extracted tooth number from notes: 46
#   🎯 New Tooth Status: root_canal
#   🎨 Color Code: #f97316 (orange)
```

## Logs to Watch

After completing an AI-scheduled appointment, you should see:

```
🦷 [TREATMENTS] Starting tooth status update:
  📅 Appointment Status: completed
  📝 Extracted from notes: "Root Canal Treatment"
  🔧 Treatment Type: Root Canal Treatment    ← Correct!
  🦷 Extracted tooth number from notes: 46
  🦷 Current Diagnosis Status: caries
  🎯 New Tooth Status: root_canal           ← Correct!
  🎨 Color Code: #f97316                    ← Orange!
  🦷 Target Tooth: 46
  ✅ Updated via patient_id + tooth_number (latest)
```

## Treatment Type Mappings

| Notes Contains | Extracted Treatment | Final Status | Color |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| "root canal", "rct" | Root Canal Treatment | root_canal | Orange |
| "filling", "restoration" | Composite Filling | filled | Blue |
| "crown", "cap" | Crown Preparation | crown | Purple |
| "extraction", "remove" | Extraction | missing | Gray |
| "pulpotomy", "pulpectomy" | Pulpotomy | filled | Blue |

## Known Limitations

1. **Requires diagnosis record**: If tooth has no diagnosis record at all, it won't update
2. **Pattern matching**: Relies on keywords in notes - unusual phrasing might not match
3. **Latest diagnosis**: Uses most recent diagnosis for that tooth, which might not always be correct

## Future Improvements

1. **Link at creation**: Have AI scheduler properly link to tooth_diagnosis_id
2. **Structured data**: Store treatment type in dedicated field instead of notes
3. **NLP extraction**: Use more sophisticated NLP to extract treatment info
4. **Create diagnosis**: Auto-create diagnosis record if missing for AI-scheduled appointments

## Summary

The fix enables AI-scheduled appointments to correctly update tooth status and colors when completed, by:
- ✅ Extracting treatment type from appointment notes
- ✅ Extracting tooth number from notes
- ✅ Using enhanced pattern matching
- ✅ Falling back to patient_id + tooth_number for updates
- ✅ Proper color mapping based on treatment type

This ensures the dental chart accurately reflects completed treatments, even when appointments are created via AI voice commands.
