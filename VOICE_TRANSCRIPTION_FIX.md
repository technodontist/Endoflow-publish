# Voice Transcription Fixes - NL Filter Input

## Date: 2025-10-08

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Gemini API Model Name Error (404)
**Problem**: The Gemini API was returning a 404 error with the message:
```
models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta
```

**Solution**: Updated the model name from `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` in `lib/services/nl-filter-extractor.ts` (line 126).

**File Changed**: 
- `lib/services/nl-filter-extractor.ts`

---

### 2. Voice Transcription Not Working
**Problem**: Voice input was not properly capturing and transcribing speech in the NL Filter Input component.

**Root Cause**: The voice transcription implementation was not following the same proven pattern used in `GlobalVoiceRecorder`, specifically:
- Missing proper separation between interim and final transcripts
- Incorrect handling of the `transcriptRef` updates
- Inadequate error handling for common speech recognition errors
- Missing comprehensive logging for debugging

**Solution**: Applied the exact pattern from `GlobalVoiceRecorder` component to the NL filter input.

**File Changed**:
- `components/dentist/nl-filter-input.tsx`

---

## Implementation Details

### Pattern Applied from GlobalVoiceRecorder

#### 1. **Dual Ref Pattern**
```typescript
const transcriptRef = useRef<string>('') // Track latest transcript value
const finalTranscriptRef = useRef<string>('') // Track only final results
```

**Why this works**:
- `finalTranscriptRef`: Accumulates **only** confirmed (final) speech results
- `transcriptRef`: Holds the combined final + interim results for display
- This prevents interim (temporary) results from being permanently added

#### 2. **Proper onresult Handler**
```typescript
recognitionRef.current.onresult = (event: any) => {
  let interimTranscript = ''
  
  // Process only the new results (starting from resultIndex)
  for (let i = event.resultIndex; i < event.results.length; i++) {
    const transcript = event.results[i][0].transcript
    if (event.results[i].isFinal) {
      // Add final result to our permanent transcript
      finalTranscriptRef.current += transcript + ' '
    } else {
      // Interim results are temporary - they replace previous interim
      interimTranscript += transcript
    }
  }
  
  // Combine final (permanent) + interim (temporary)
  const fullTranscript = finalTranscriptRef.current + interimTranscript
  transcriptRef.current = fullTranscript
  setTranscript(fullTranscript)
}
```

**Key insight**: Interim results are **temporary** and get replaced, not accumulated.

#### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
```typescript
recognitionRef.current.onerror = (event: any) => {
  if (event.error === 'no-speech') {
    return // Don't show error for no-speech
  }
  if (event.error === 'aborted') {
    return // Don't show error for normal stops
  }
  setError(`Voice recognition error: ${event.error}`)
  setIsRecording(false)
}
```

**Why this matters**: Common errors like `no-speech` and `aborted` are non-critical and shouldn't interrupt the user experience.

#### 4. **Comprehensive Logging**
Added emoji-prefixed console logs throughout the lifecycle:
- 🎤 Start/result events
- ✅ Final transcripts
- ⏳ Interim transcripts
- 📝 Accumulated transcripts
- 📊 Display updates
- 🛑 Stop events
- ❌ Errors

**Benefits**: Makes debugging voice issues much easier.

#### 5. **Proper Cleanup and Reset**
```typescript
// On start
transcriptRef.current = ''
finalTranscriptRef.current = ''

// On stop
const finalText = finalTranscriptRef.current.trim()
if (finalText) {
  setTextInput(finalText)
} else {
  setError('No speech was detected. Please try again and speak clearly.')
}
```

**Why this works**: Ensures clean state between recordings and provides user feedback.

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Gemini API Fix
1. Navigate to the Research Projects page
2. Click on "Natural Language Filters"
3. Type or speak: "find me all patients with diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis"
4. Click "Extract Filters"
5. ✅ Should successfully extract filters without 404 error

### 2. Test Voice Transcription
1. Navigate to the Research Projects page with NL Filter Input
2. Open browser console (F12) to see logs
3. Click the "Voice Input" button
4. Look for: `🎤 [NL FILTER] Speech recognition started`
5. Speak clearly: "show me patients over 30 with moderate caries"
6. Watch the console for:
   - ⏳ Interim transcripts (temporary, as you speak)
   - ✅ Final transcripts (confirmed, after pauses)
7. Click "Stop Recording"
8. ✅ Should see the complete transcript in the text area

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Voice recognition not supported"
**Solution**: Use Chrome, Edge, or Safari (Firefox doesn't support Web Speech API well)

#### Issue: No transcript captured
**Solution**: 
- Check microphone permissions
- Speak clearly and loud enough
- Check console for errors
- Ensure you're on HTTPS (or localhost)

#### Issue: Transcript stops mid-sentence
**Solution**: This is normal - the API has timeout limits. The `onend` handler will auto-restart recognition.

## Browser Compatibility

### Web Speech API Support
- ✅ **Chrome/Chromium**: Full support
- ✅ **Edge**: Full support  
- ⚠️ **Safari**: Partial support (iOS may have issues)
- ❌ **Firefox**: Limited/no support

### Requirements
- HTTPS connection (or localhost for development)
- Microphone permissions granted
- Active internet connection (API calls Google's servers)

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (Broken)
```
User speaks → Web Speech API → Single ref → State → Display
                                    ↓
                         (Interim and final mixed together)
```

### After (Working)
```
User speaks → Web Speech API → Separate handling
                                    ↓
                        ┌───────────┴───────────┐
                        ↓                       ↓
                Final results            Interim results
                      ↓                       ↓
              finalTranscriptRef        (temporary var)
                      ↓                       ↓
                      └───────┬───────────────┘
                              ↓
                    Combined → transcriptRef
                              ↓
                          State → Display
```
