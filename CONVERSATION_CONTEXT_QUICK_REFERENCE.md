# 🚀 Conversation Context - Quick Reference

**Status**: ✅ Operational  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-12

---

## 📌 What It Does

Allows multi-turn conversations with the AI where context is maintained across queries.

**Example**:
```
User: "Show me October appointments"
AI: "Found 5 appointments..."

User: "How many patients?" ← AI knows you mean October
AI: "5 patients in October"
```

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **ConversationId** stored in browser localStorage
2. **Passed to backend** with each query
3. **Backend retrieves** conversation history from database
4. **AI uses history** to understand context
5. **Same conversationId** maintained throughout conversation

## 📂 Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `components/dentist/endoflow-voice-controller.tsx` | Frontend - manages conversationId state |
| `lib/actions/endoflow-master.ts` | Backend - retrieves/saves conversation history |
| `api.endoflow_conversations` | Database table storing conversations |

---

## 🔍 Debug Commands

### Check ConversationId in Browser
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('endoflow_current_conversation_id')
```

### Clear ConversationId
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('endoflow_current_conversation_id')
```

### Check All localStorage
```javascript
Object.keys(localStorage)
```

## 📊 Console Logs to Watch

### ✅ Good Signs
```
💾 [PERSISTENCE] Initializing with conversation ID from localStorage: ...
📤 [ENDOFLOW] Sending query: ... conversationId: [uuid]
✅ [ENDOFLOW ACTION] Loaded conversation history: X messages
```

### ❌ Warning Signs
```
conversationId: null (when you expected a UUID)
Failed to fetch conversation history
```

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. Open voice AI
2. Ask: "Show me October appointments"
3. Check console: Should save conversationId
4. Ask: "How many patients?"
5. Check console: Should use SAME conversationId
6. AI should understand "patients" = "patients in October"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Context not working | Check conversationId is same across queries |
| ConversationId is null | Check localStorage, not in incognito mode |
| AI doesn't understand follow-up | Check backend logs for "Loaded conversation history" |
| ConversationId changes each query | See technical documentation |
