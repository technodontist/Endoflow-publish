## 📝 Example Upload

### **Sample Research Paper**:

```
Title: Modern Endodontic Treatment: Success Rates with Rotary NiTi Files

Content:
Root canal treatment with modern nickel-titanium rotary instrumentation
achieves success rates of 90-95% in primary endodontic cases. Studies
demonstrate that single-visit RCT is as effective as multiple-visit
approaches when proper infection control protocols are followed. The use
of bioceramic sealers has shown superior outcomes compared to traditional
gutta-percha with resin-based sealers...

Source Type: Research Paper

Specialty: Endodontics

Authors: Smith J, Johnson K, Lee M

Publication Year: 2023

Journal: Journal of Endodontics

DOI: 10.1016/j.joen.2023.001

Topics:
- root_canal
- rotary_instrumentation
- niti_files
- bioceramic_sealers

Diagnosis Keywords:
- irreversible_pulpitis
- pulp_necrosis
- apical_periodontitis

Treatment Keywords:
- rct
- root_canal_treatment
- rotary_files
- single_visit_rct
```

**Click Upload** → Done! ✅

## 🧪 Test It Immediately

After uploading, test that RAG is working:

1. Go to **Research Projects** or **Research V2 (Advanced)** tab
2. Look for **Clinical Research Assistant** panel on the right
3. Ask: "What does the literature say about RCT success rates?"
4. You should see response with **[Source 1]** citation!

**Expected Response**:
```
Based on the literature [Source 1], modern RCT with rotary instrumentation
achieves 90-95% success rates. Single-visit approaches are as effective as
multiple visits when infection control is maintained [Source 1].

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Can't Find the Tab?**
- Make sure you're logged in as a dentist (not assistant or patient)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check you're on `/dentist` URL
- Look for "Medical Knowledge" in the top tabs (may need to scroll horizontally)

### **Upload Button Disabled?**
- Make sure all required fields are filled:
  - Title
  - Content (at least 100 characters)
  - At least 1 topic tag
  - At least 1 diagnosis keyword
  - At least 1 treatment keyword

### **Upload Fails?**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify you're logged in as active dentist
- Make sure content isn't too long (< 10,000 characters recommended)
- Try shorter content or split into multiple documents

### **RAG Not Working After Upload?**
- Wait 5-10 seconds for embedding generation
- Refresh the Research Projects page
- Try a different query that matches your tags
- Check the test script: `node test-rag-system.js`
