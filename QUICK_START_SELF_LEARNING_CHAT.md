# 🚀 Quick Start: Self-Learning Chat Persistence

## ⚡ TL;DR

Chat sessions for the Self-Learning AI Assistant now persist to database. Follow these steps to deploy:

### 1️⃣ Run Database Migration (5 minutes)

1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open file: `lib/db/migrations/add_self_learning_chat_sessions.sql`
4. Copy entire contents and paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **Run**
6. Wait for success message

### 2️⃣ Verify Migration (2 minutes)

Run this query in SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'api' AND table_name = 'self_learning_chat_sessions') AS sessions_table,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'api' AND table_name = 'self_learning_messages') AS messages_table;
```

Expected result: Both should return `1`

### 3️⃣ Test the Feature (3 minutes)

1. Start your Next.js dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Log in as a dentist user
3. Navigate to **Self Learning Assistant**
4. Click **AI Chat Assistant** tab
5. You should see:
   - Session sidebar on the left
   - "New Chat" button
   - Empty state message

### 4️⃣ Test Basic Flow (5 minutes)

1. Click **"New Chat"** → New session created
2. Type a question → Message saves to database
3. Check session title updates automatically
4. Refresh page → Messages should persist
5. Click **"New Chat"** again → Can switch between sessions
6. Hover over session → Delete button appears
7. Click delete → Session removed
