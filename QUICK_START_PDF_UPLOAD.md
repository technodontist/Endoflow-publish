2. ‚úÖ Text is extracted from all pages using pdfjs-dist
3. ‚úÖ Gemini AI generates 768-dimensional embeddings
4. ‚úÖ Full text + embeddings stored in Supabase vector database
5. ‚úÖ Content is now searchable by the RAG system
6. ‚úÖ AI can cite this source in treatment recommendations

## Test the RAG System:

After uploading PDFs, go to "Research Assistant" and ask:
- "What are the best practices for root canal treatment?"
- "Show me evidence for endodontic success rates"
- "What does the research say about bioceramic sealers?"

The AI will search your uploaded PDFs and provide evidence-based answers with citations!

## Key Features:

‚úÖ **Drag & Drop Interface** - Easy file upload
‚úÖ **Automatic Text Extraction** - From all PDF pages
‚úÖ **Metadata Auto-Fill** - Title from filename
‚úÖ **Text Preview** - See what was extracted
‚úÖ **Vector Search Ready** - Instant AI integration
‚úÖ **Citation Support** - AI references your sources

## Current Server Status:

```
‚úÖ Running on: http://localhost:3000
‚úÖ Network: http://192.168.1.9:3000
‚úÖ PDF Upload: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

## Example Test PDF:

Try uploading any dental research paper PDF about:
- Root canal treatments
- Endodontic procedures
- Clinical protocols
- Treatment success rates
- Diagnostic guidelines

## Next Steps:

1. Upload 2-3 research PDFs to build your knowledge base
2. Test the RAG system with clinical questions
3. See AI provide evidence-based recommendations with citations
4. Enjoy your AI-powered clinical decision support system! üéâ
