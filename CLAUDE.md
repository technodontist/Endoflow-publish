# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ENDOFLOW is an AI-powered SaaS application for dental clinics that automates clinical workflows. Built on a Next.js 14+ (App Router) foundation with three distinct role-based dashboards.

### 🔥 CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Problem**: The middleware is looking for a `profiles` table with role/status columns, but the database schema uses separate role-specific tables (`api.assistants`, `api.dentists`, `api.patients`). This causes authenticated users to bypass the login page and go directly to role dashboards without proper role verification.

**Root Cause**: Schema mismatch between middleware expectations and actual database structure.

### Role-Based Dashboard Architecture

#### 1. **Patient Dashboard** (Mobile-First Design)
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab bar with 4 main sections (Home, Appointments, Messages, Library)
- **Key Features**:
  - Home tab with upcoming appointments and quick actions
  - Appointment booking with time selection and pain level assessment
  - Messages tab with AI chatbot and urgent assistance feature
  - My Files tab with intake forms and document management
  - Library tab with educational content and resources
- **UI Design**: Clean mobile interface with teal accent color (#009688)
- **Special Features**: Emergency urgent assistance, appointment rescheduling, notification center

#### 2. **Assistant Dashboard** (Task-Oriented Workflow)

```

## File Structure & Key Locations

### Core Application Structure
- `/app/(login)/` - Authentication pages (sign-in, sign-up)
- `/app/(dashboard)/` - Protected dashboard routes
- `/lib/db/` - Database schema, migrations, and utilities
- `/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui component library
- `/schema ss/temp/` - v0.dev prototype components and reference screenshots organized by dashboard type
  - `/login-page/` - Login and registration components with welcome screens
  - `/patient-dashboard/` - Mobile-first patient interface components and UI screenshots
  - `/assistant-dashboard/` - Task-oriented assistant workflow components and screenshots
  - `/dentist-dashboard/` - Advanced clinical cockpit components and feature screenshots

### Database Schema Structure (CORRECTED)

**🚨 CRITICAL SCHEMA ARCHITECTURE:**
Based on the schema diagram in `schema ss/` folder, the ENDOFLOW database follows this structure:

#### Core Authentication Tables
- **`auth.users`**: Supabase built-in authentication table (id, email, created_at)
- **`public.profiles`**: **MAIN USER PROFILE TABLE** - connects to auth.users.id
  - `id` (uuid, references auth.users.id)
  - `role` (text: 'patient' | 'assistant' | 'dentist')
  - `status` (text: 'active' | 'pending' | 'inactive')
  - `full_name` (text)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)

#### Role-Specific Data Tables (All reference profiles.id)
- **`api.patients`**: Extended patient data (id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, medical_history_summary, created_at)
- **`api.assistants`**: Extended assistant data (id, full_name, created_at)
- **`api.dentists`**: Extended dentist data (id, full_name, specialty, created_at)

#### Application Tables
- **`api.pending_registrations`**: New user registrations awaiting approval
- **`api.appointments`**: Patient appointments
- **`api.treatments`**: Treatment records
- **`api.diagnoses`**: Diagnosis records
- **`api.messages`**: In-app messaging
- **`api.tasks`**: Assistant task management
- And many more clinical workflow tables

### Database Flow
1. **User signs up** → Entry created in `auth.users`
2. **Profile created** → Entry in `public.profiles` with role and status
3. **Role-specific data** → Additional data in `api.patients/assistants/dentists`
4. **Authentication checks** → Always query `profiles` table for role and status

### Previous Authentication Error
❌ **MISTAKE**: The authentication logic was incorrectly trying to query separate role tables directly instead of the central `profiles` table
✅ **CORRECT**: All authentication should use `profiles` table as the single source of truth for user roles and status

### Authentication Flow
- Login page serves as landing page
- Sign-up triggers comprehensive Digital Intake Form
- Account verification required before login access
- Role-based dashboard routing post-authentication

## Development Guidelines

### Component Integration
- Start with prototypes in `/temp/` directories
- Each dashboard type has complete v0.dev components and UI screenshots
- Replace starter template components systematically
- Maintain role-based access patterns throughout

### Backend Integration Phases
1. **Authentication Setup**: Implement Supabase auth with role routing
2. **Dashboard Assembly**: Replace mock data with live Supabase connections
3. **Feature Integration**: Connect n8n workflows for automation
4. **Real-time Features**: Implement live updates across dashboards

### Database Workflow
- Use Drizzle ORM for all database operations
- Run migrations before making schema changes
- Seed database for development testing
- Use Drizzle Studio for visual database management

### Role-Based Architecture
- Patient routes: Mobile-optimized with bottom navigation
- Assistant routes: Task-focused with sidebar navigation
- Dentist routes: Full-featured with top tab navigation
- Implement proper route guards for role-specific access

## Tech Stack Integration

## 🔧 **LOGIN VERIFICATION DEBUG GUIDE**

### Issue: Assistant-Created Patients Getting Pending Status Instead of Active

**Problem**: Patients created by assistants through `/assistant/register` were incorrectly getting `pending` status instead of `active` status, preventing immediate login.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Two Registration Flows Exist** (by design):
   - **Public Self-Registration** (`/signup`) → `patientSignup()` → `pending` status (needs approval) ✅
   - **Assistant Manual Registration** (`/assistant/register`) → `manualPatientRegistration()` → `active` status (immediate login) ✅

2. **Bug Location**: `lib/actions/patient-registration.ts:94-96`
   - Profile creation errors were being ignored (except duplicates)
   - If profile creation failed, database created profile with default `pending` status
   - Schema default: `status: text('status').notNull().default('pending')`

**Debugging Process**:
```bash
# 1. Check patient database state
node check-patient-status.js

# 2. Verify registration flow used
- No pending_registrations record = Assistant registration ✅
- Has pending_registrations record = Self registration ✅

# 3. Check profile status
- ACTIVE = Can login immediately ✅
- PENDING = Needs approval ❌ (bug if assistant-created)
```

**Solution Applied**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (lib/actions/patient-registration.ts:94-96)
if (profileError && profileError.code !== '23505') {
  console.error('Failed to create profile:', profileError.message)
  // Don't fail the whole operation for this ❌ WRONG
}

// AFTER (Fixed)
if (profileError) {
  if (profileError.code === '23505') {
    // Update existing profile to active
    await supabase.from('profiles').update({ status: 'active' })
  } else {
    // BLOCK operation if profile creation fails ✅ FIXED
    return { error: 'Failed to create active patient profile' }
  }
}
```

**Enhanced Logging Added**:
- `🏥 [MANUAL REGISTRATION] ⚡ ASSISTANT-CREATED PATIENT ⚡` → ACTIVE status
- `👤 [PATIENT SIGNUP] 🔒 SELF-REGISTERED PATIENT 🔒` → PENDING status

**Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Test both flows work correctly
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="..." SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="..." node verify-registration-flows.js
```

**Key Takeaway**: Always ensure error handling doesn't silently break critical business logic. Assistant-created patients MUST get active status for immediate login access.

## 📁 **FILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### **Overview**
Complete medical file upload and management system allowing assistants and dentists to upload patient medical images (X-rays, oral photos, CBCT scans) with metadata and descriptions. Files are stored securely in Supabase Storage and displayed across all three dashboards.

### **Architecture Components**

#### **1. Database Schema** (`lib/db/schema.ts`)
```typescript
export const patientFiles = apiSchema.table('patient_files', {
  id: uuid('id').primaryKey().default('gen_random_uuid()'),
  patientId: uuid('patient_id').notNull(), // References auth.users.id
  uploadedBy: uuid('uploaded_by').notNull(), // Assistant/dentist who uploaded
  fileName: text('file_name').notNull(),
  originalFileName: text('original_file_name').notNull(),
  filePath: text('file_path').notNull(), // Supabase storage path
  fileSize: integer('file_size').notNull(), // in bytes
  mimeType: text('mime_type').notNull(),
  fileType: text('file_type').notNull(), // X-Ray, Oral Photo, etc.
  description: text('description').notNull(), // Legend/description
  isArchived: boolean('is_archived').notNull().default(false),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow().notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at').defaultNow().notNull(),
});
```

#### **2. Storage Architecture**
- **Bucket**: `medical-files` (Private)
- **Path Structure**: `patient-files/{patientId}/{uniqueFileName}`
- **File Types**: Images only (JPG, PNG, JPEG) up to 10MB
- **Security**: Signed URLs for secure access, service role permissions

#### **3. Server Actions** (`lib/actions/patient-files.ts`)
- **`uploadPatientFileAction(formData)`**: Complete upload workflow
  - User permission validation (assistant/dentist only)
  - File validation (type, size limits)
  - Supabase Storage upload
  - Database metadata storage
  - Cross-dashboard revalidation
- **`getPatientFilesAction(patientId)`**: Retrieve patient's files
- **`getFileUrlAction(filePath)`**: Generate secure signed URLs
- **`deletePatientFileAction(fileId)`**: Archive files (soft delete)

### **User Interface Components**

#### **Assistant File Uploader** (`/assistant/files`)
**Location**: `components/assistant/file-uploader-interface.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Patient Selection**: Search and select any patient
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Modern file upload with preview
- **File Type Classification**: X-Ray, Oral Photo, CBCT Scan, Treatment Plan, etc.
- **Metadata Input**: Description/legend for each file
- **Batch Upload**: Multiple files with individual metadata
- **Real-time Feedback**: Upload progress and error handling

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
interface FileUpload {
  file: File
  preview: string  // Base64 preview
  type: string     // Medical file type
  legend: string   // Description
  id: string       // Unique identifier
}
```

#### **Cross-Dashboard Integration**
- **Real-time Updates**: Files appear instantly across all dashboards after upload
- **Revalidation**: Automatic cache invalidation for `/assistant/files`, `/patient`, `/dentist`
- **Security**: Role-based access with Row Level Security policies

### **Setup Requirements**

#### **Database Setup**
1. **Table Creation**: Run `CREATE_PATIENT_FILES_TABLE_SAFE.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Permissions**: Execute `SIMPLE_TABLE_FIX.sql` for proper access rights

#### **Storage Setup**
1. **Manual Bucket Creation** (Required):
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
   - Create bucket named `medical-files`
   - Set to Private
   - Supabase handles basic authenticated access automatically

#### **Verification Scripts**
```bash
# Test storage and table setup
node test-storage-setup.js

# Test bucket creation only
node test-bucket-only.js

# Verify complete setup
node verify-storage-complete.js
```

### **Error Handling & Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Issues**
1. **"Failed to save file metadata"**: Database table missing or permission issues
   - **Solution**: Run `SIMPLE_TABLE_FIX.sql`

2. **"Storage bucket not configured"**: Bucket doesn't exist
   - **Solution**: Create `medical-files` bucket manually in Supabase Dashboard

3. **"Storage access denied"**: Policy configuration issues
   - **Solution**: Service role has elevated permissions, should work with private bucket

#### **Enhanced Error Messages**
The upload action provides specific error guidance:
- Missing bucket → "Please create medical-files bucket in Supabase Dashboard"
- Policy issues → "Run STORAGE_SETUP_NO_PERMS.sql in Supabase SQL Editor"
- File validation → Clear messages about file type/size limits

### **Security Model**

#### **Row Level Security Policies**
```sql
-- Staff can upload files
CREATE POLICY "Staff can upload patient files" ON api.patient_files
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
        WHERE id = auth.uid()
        AND role IN ('assistant', 'dentist')
        AND status = 'active'
    )
    AND uploaded_by = auth.uid()
);

-- Users can view files (patients see own, staff see all)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view patient files" ON api.patient_files
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
    patient_id = auth.uid() OR
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
        WHERE id = auth.uid()
        AND role IN ('assistant', 'dentist')
        AND status = 'active'
    )
);
```

#### **File Access Security**
- **Signed URLs**: 1-hour expiry for secure file access
- **Service Role**: Backend operations use elevated permissions
- **Client Access**: Frontend uses signed URLs, never direct storage access

### **Integration Status**

#### **✅ Completed**
- Assistant file upload interface with full functionality
- Database schema and server actions
- Storage configuration and security
- Error handling and validation
- Setup scripts and documentation

#### **🔄 Next Phase: Display Integration**

#### **2. Server Actions** (`lib/actions/assistant-tasks.ts`)

**Enhanced Data Fetching with Manual Profile Joining:**
- **`getTasksAction(filters)`**: Fetches tasks with automatic profile joining
  - Manually joins `assigned_to_profile` and `created_by_profile` data
  - Resolves foreign key relationship issues between `api.assistant_tasks` and `public.profiles`
  - Provides `full_name` data for UI display
- **`getTaskCommentsAction(taskId)`**: Fetches comments with author profile information
  - Manually joins author profiles to prevent `undefined` errors
  - Maps `author_id` to `author.full_name` for UI consumption
- **`createTaskAction(formData)`**: Complete task creation with automatic assignment
  - Auto-assigns to Test Assistant if no assignment provided
  - Handles patient linking and metadata
  - Activity logging and cross-dashboard revalidation
- **`updateTaskStatusAction(taskId, status)`**: Status management with timestamps
- **`addTaskCommentAction(taskId, comment)`**: Comment system with activity logging
- **`getAvailableAssistantsAction()`**: Assistant selection for task assignment
- **`assignTaskAction(taskId, assistantId)`**: Task assignment management
- **`getTaskStatsAction()`**: Dashboard statistics and analytics

#### **3. Enhanced Query Logic**
**Problem Solved**: Tasks were showing "Unassigned" in UI despite being assigned in database.

**Root Cause**: UI components expected `assigned_to_profile.full_name` but server actions only returned raw task data without joined profile information.

**Solution**: Manual profile joining in server actions:
```typescript
// Enhanced getTasksAction with profile joining
if (tasks && tasks.length > 0) {
  const assignedIds = [...new Set(tasks.map(t => t.assigned_to).filter(Boolean))]
  const createdByIds = [...new Set(tasks.map(t => t.created_by))]
  const allUserIds = [...new Set([...assignedIds, ...createdByIds])]

  const { data: profiles } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('id, full_name')
    .in('id', allUserIds)

  if (profiles) {
    const profileMap = new Map(profiles.map(p => [p.id, p]))
    const tasksWithProfiles = tasks.map(task => ({
      ...task,
      assigned_to_profile: task.assigned_to ? profileMap.get(task.assigned_to) : null,
      created_by_profile: profileMap.get(task.created_by)
    }))
    return { success: true, tasks: tasksWithProfiles }
  }
}
```

### **Error Resolution**

#### **Common Issues Fixed**
1. **"Tasks showing Unassigned"**: Fixed by implementing manual profile joining in `getTasksAction`
2. **"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'full_name')"**: Fixed by enhancing `getTaskCommentsAction` with author profile data
3. **"Could not find relationship between tables"**: Resolved by manual joining instead of foreign key relationships
4. **"Table not found errors"**: Fixed by proper database table creation
