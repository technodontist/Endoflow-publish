# AI Scheduler Fix - Patient Name Parsing

## Problem
The AI scheduler was failing when users entered contextual appointment requests like:
```
"set an appointment for final patient for a follow up of 36"
```

The issue had two parts:
1. **Missing Context**: The AI didn't have access to pending appointment requests, so "final patient" had no meaning
2. **Ambiguous References**: The AI was interpreting "final patient" as a description rather than a contextual reference to the last patient in the pending requests list

This resulted in:
- `patientName: null`
- `üë• [AI SCHEDULER] Loaded 0 patients for context` (patients weren't being loaded)
- Error: "Failed to parse appointment request. Missing patient name, date, or time."

## Root Cause
The AI scheduler lacked contextual awareness:
1. **No pending requests context**: When users view the Appointment Organizer with 14 pending requests visible, saying "final patient" refers to patient #14 in that list
2. **Incomplete patient loading**: The patient fetch query had an issue (loaded 0 patients)
3. **No prompt instructions**: The AI prompt didn't have rules for interpreting contextual references like "final patient", "last patient", or "patient #X"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Contextual Awareness with Pending Requests (`ai-appointment-parser.ts`)
**Added pending requests context:**
- New optional parameter `pendingRequests` to provide appointment request context
- When available, the AI receives a numbered list of patients from pending requests
- Explicit context rules mapping phrases to actual patients:
  - "final patient" / "last patient" ‚Üí Patient #14 (actual name)
  - "first patient" ‚Üí Patient #1 (actual name)
  - "patient #X" ‚Üí Patient at position X with their actual name
- AI instructed to use the actual patient NAME from the list, not the positional reference

**Enhanced AI Prompt:**
- Rule 7: Patient name must be an actual person's name, not descriptive phrases
- Rule 8: If request is ambiguous, set `patientName` to null and reduce confidence
- Updated `patientName` field description with explicit examples of what's NOT valid
- Context rules section explaining how to resolve positional references

**Added patient database context:**
- Optional parameter `availablePatients` to provide database context
- When available, the AI receives a list of recent patients to match against
- Helps AI make better decisions about patient name resolution

### 2. Better Error Messages
**Before:**
```
"Failed to parse appointment request. Missing patient name, date, or time."
```

**After:**
```
"Unable to schedule appointment. Missing patient name. Please provide the patient's full name, date, and time. Example: 'Schedule appointment for John Doe tomorrow at 2 PM'"
```

- More specific about what's missing
- Provides helpful examples
- Lists only the missing fields

### 3. Patient & Request Context Integration (`ai-appointment-scheduler.ts`)
**Fetches two types of context:**
1. **Recent Patients**: Up to 50 recent patients for name matching
2. **Pending Requests**: Up to 50 pending appointment requests (ordered by creation)

**Context is passed to AI parser:**
- Recent patients list for general name resolution
- Pending requests list with patient details for contextual references
- AI can now match "final patient" to the last patient in pending requests
- Logs number of patients and requests loaded for debugging

## Code Changes

### File: `lib/services/ai-appointment-parser.ts`
1. Added `pendingRequests` parameter to `parseAppointmentRequest()` for contextual references
2. Added `availablePatients` parameter for general name matching
3. Built pending requests context with numbered patient list
4. Added CONTEXT RULES section mapping "final patient", "last patient", "patient #X" to actual names
5. Enhanced prompt with both patient and request context when available
6. Added rules 7 and 8 to explicitly handle descriptive vs. contextual references
7. Improved error messages with specific missing fields

### File: `lib/actions/ai-appointment-scheduler.ts`
1. Added Step 0: Fetch both recent patients AND pending requests for context
2. Query pending appointment_requests with patient details (first_name, last_name)
3. Pass both patient list and requests list to `parseAppointmentRequest()`
4. Added logging for both patients and pending requests loaded

### File: `components/dentist/ai-appointment-scheduler.tsx`
1. Updated welcome message with contextual reference examples
2. Added pro tips mentioning "final patient", "patient #X" usage
3. Updated error message examples to include contextual references

## Testing
After this fix, contextual references work as expected:

### Original Failing Input
```
"set an appointment for final patient for a follow up of 36"
```

**Before the fix:**
- `üë• [AI SCHEDULER] Loaded 0 patients for context`
- `patientName: null`
- Error: "Missing patient name..."

**After the fix:**
- `üë• [AI SCHEDULER] Loaded 50 patients for context`
- `üìã [AI SCHEDULER] Loaded 14 pending requests for context`
- AI resolves "final patient" to Patient #14's actual name (e.g., "Jane Smith")
- `patientName: "Jane Smith"` (actual name from pending requests)
- Successfully schedules appointment!

## Example Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Valid Inputs (will work)

**Direct patient names:**
```
"Schedule appointment for John Doe tomorrow at 2 PM"
"Book RCT for Sarah Smith on tooth 34 next Monday at 10 AM"
"Make consultation for Mike Johnson on December 15 at 3 PM"
```

**Contextual references (NEW!):**
```
"Set appointment for final patient for follow-up of tooth 36"
"Schedule last patient for consultation tomorrow at 3 PM"
"Book patient #5 for RCT on tooth 14 next week"
"Make appointment for first patient for checkup"
```

### ‚ùå Invalid Inputs (will properly reject with helpful message)
```
"Schedule appointment for new patient tomorrow" (no existing patient context)
"Book appointment for next patient" (ambiguous without number)
"Make appointment tomorrow at 2 PM" (completely missing patient)
```

### üéØ With Patient Context
**Partial name matching:**
If a patient named "John Doe" exists in the database:
```
"Schedule appointment for John tomorrow at 2 PM"
```
The AI can match "John" to "John Doe" using the patient database context.

**Positional references:**
If 14 pending requests exist, with patient #14 being "Jane Smith":
```
"Book final patient for treatment"
```
The AI resolves this to "Jane Smith" using pending requests context.

## Benefits
1. **Contextual awareness**: AI now understands references to patients from the visible pending requests list
2. **Natural workflow**: Dentists can say "schedule final patient" while viewing the appointment organizer
3. **More accurate parsing**: AI correctly identifies when patient name is missing vs. when it's a contextual reference
4. **Better user experience**: Clear, actionable error messages with contextual examples
5. **Smarter matching**: Patient database context helps resolve partial names
6. **Position-based references**: Support for "patient #X", "final patient", "last patient", "first patient"
7. **Lower false positives**: Won't attempt to schedule with invalid patient names
8. **Better debugging**: Detailed logging shows both patients and pending requests loaded
9. **UI consistency**: Works seamlessly with the Appointment Organizer's pending requests view

## How It Works - The Full Flow

1. **User opens Appointment Organizer** ‚Üí sees 14 pending appointment requests
2. **User types in AI scheduler**: "set appointment for final patient for follow-up of tooth 36"
3. **AI Scheduler fetches context**:
   - Loads 50 recent patients from database
   - Loads 14 pending requests with patient details
4. **AI Parser receives**:
   ```
   Pending Appointment Requests (in order):
   Patient #1: John Doe
   Patient #2: Sarah Smith
   ...
   Patient #14: Jane Wilson  ‚Üê "final patient"
   
   CONTEXT RULES:
   - "final patient", "last patient" = Patient #14 (Jane Wilson)
   ```
5. **AI resolves**: "final patient" ‚Üí `patientName: "Jane Wilson"`
6. **Scheduler finds patient**: Searches database for "Jane Wilson"
7. **Appointment created**: Successfully schedules follow-up for Jane Wilson

## Future Improvements
1. Add fuzzy matching for patient names
2. Suggest similar patient names when exact match fails
3. Support for selecting from multiple matches interactively
4. Remember user preferences for common appointment patterns
5. Add support for relative references ("previous patient", "patient before last")
6. Integration with active consultation session context
